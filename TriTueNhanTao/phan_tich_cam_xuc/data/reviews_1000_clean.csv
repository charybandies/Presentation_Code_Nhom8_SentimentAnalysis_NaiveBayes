"This sweater is so beautiful on. it is thick material, but does not make you look boxy. it fits so nicely and is flattering. the design is just gorgeous. if you are considering this sweater-- get it, you won't regret it!

i'm normally a small (4-6) and i ordered a small. it fits true to size. the fit is *perfect* so if you want it slightly more relaxed, order one size up.",Positive
"This piece is almost what i want... i tried on the white version in an xs and it felt a little too large for me, even though it's meant to be a looser fit. the buttercup yellow behind the lace is very pretty - i especially love that part of this tank. it provides a nice contrast and allows the detail to stand out. the navy is also nice (it was on display next to the white and looks better in person than online). what i didn't like was the texture of the spandex on the back portion. it looks like",Positive
Really like this blouse but am returning for a larger size. much too tight in the upper arms and somewhat tight in the chest - overall i like it.,Positive
"These are the perfect light weight relaxing summer pants!
the fabric is soft and light, and has some stretch, so i think they can be worn more fitted way, too. 
i don't want to show off my bottom half of my body shape, so these are perfect ones to be a bit loose to covers the silhouette but still looks feminine & not too loose. 
i''m 5'3, 115 lb and usually wear 25-26 jeans, 25 petite gave me the perfect relaxed look without losing the feminine look. i think 24 could fit as well, but would sn",Positive
These look nothing like the picture! they are super high-waisted & longer than they look in this picture. i felt as if i was wearing a pair of jeans from the 90's that just fit terribly. i thought they were going to be a pair of cropped wide legs & they are far from it. the color was also much lighter than shown in picture. super unflattering & just not for me. they're going back...,Negative
"I ordered this shirt and was happy to see that it looks just like it does online -- i love the rusty orange and pale blue contrast with the navy. the navy blue underlayer is so flattering, and the sheer sleeves are feminine and lovely. the shape and pattern are forgiving. this brand is really hitting it out of the park these days. this blouse runs a bit smaller than some meadow rue. if you're between sizes (especially arm-wise), i'd order up. otherwise just get your regular size. the body is flo",Positive
"On the hanger, this looks like a great lbd. on me, not quite. the bell shape of this dress made it appear that i was carrying extra weight in the middle.  for reference, i tried a 0p, and i'm 5,1"", 102#, and 34a.",Positive
Love this cardigan! i've been searching for a comfortable lounge type of sweater and this is perfect. the sleeves are a bit tighter than the body. but i would wear it over a tank top so it is comfortable. i am 125 lb and 5'5' and i ordered my usual m.,Positive
"I was immediately drawn to the ochre yellow color of this dress and it's stitch and pleat details and was happy to score it early enough in the season still in my size and preferred color option. unlike other reviewers, i was not turned off by the ribbing at the neck and arm lines. i received the dress yesterday, am wearing it today, and have already received compliments from even the most sour-faced co-workers who can't give a compliment or share casual conversation in the hallway. the sunny ye",Positive
"I loved this jacket! it's exactly what i was looking for. i set out to find a lightweight sweater or jacket that would keep me warm and also versatile enough to wear with different outfits. this definitely fit the bill! in addition, it's really soft and not at all itchy, which was a concern i had since it was wool and i ordered it online. i have received a bunch of compliments! i definitely recommend it!",Positive
"Several months ago i bought the byron lars pieced brocade dress (size 10) it's a little large through the torso area but with the belt it fits good enough. since i have loved this dress so much i wanted another byron lars dress so i bought the carissima sheath and the sunrose dress both in a 10. they both were way too big so i ordered a size 8 and they both just barely fit ??? oh was i disappointed....so one more try, i ordered this dress the allusione sheath size 10, and yepeee it fits perfect",Positive
The stitched pattern on this shirt is so pretty! it fits loosely and looks good with a slimmer bottom. it is a little bit itchy but i didn't feel i needed to wear something underneath.,Positive
"This is a pretty blouse that is also very comfortable. i am always an xl in retailer tops, but i needed to go down to a large on this one. this blouse is cut generously everywhere, but going down one size was perfect for me. the fabric in the back falls from the shoulder blade area, so it has a very nice drape in the back. the sleeve cuffs and placket are some sort of cotton, so the cuff made a nice base to fold the sleeve around and up to the elbow. i wore a nude bra underneath, and i can't see m",Positive
"Love this, but it is not a true white. it's slightly ivory, winter white. please be accurate with color descriptions! it's extremely frustrating when online retailers don't describe colors accurately. it can be hard to see subtle color differences in photos (especially with the color white) due to lighting of the shot. we rely on descriptions when ordering online. it's not difficult to do, really it's not.

that said, i didn't have any armhole trouble as others did. they were sized just right,",Positive
"I love the style and quality of this skirt. the material is a bit heavier than anticipated, so it works well in cooler months, and the thickness makes it easy to wear a shirt underneath. it fits true to size - my usual 6 is form-fitting without being overly snug or pulled.

i am on the taller side, and the skirt is fairly long - it comes to the bottom of my knee.",Positive
"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 143 lbs, and 38-32-40 and my normal size 10s fit me perfectly.",Positive
I really liked this top when i saw it online. i went to the store to check the sizes. i am a small or a medium. i tried on the s and the xs. even the xs was huge. unfortunately the xxs is sold out. i don't understand the sizing on this at all. it's a shame because the top itself is very pretty. just be sure you try it on before purchasing.,Neutral
I returned the dress because the color was not as pictured in the online photo. i did not like the color.,Negative
This skirt is amazing! it has the right amount of sparkle and the right amount of shape. i bought this in a size six which i can really switch between 6 and 8 depending but the six fits perfectly. i also bought the regular length even though i could probably be considered petite but it ended up being perfect. but the skirt is so lovely in person and has just enough wow that you can wear this thing with a simple tee and still look amazing. i wore this to a party with a black high neck tank and re,Positive
"I did like the dress, but don't love it. i think it would have been better for me if it were snugger. the xxs petite was still loose and i found that there are so many dresses with the similar fit, i decided to pass... i also do like both colors, the brown is a better choice for me on my skin tone (warmer), but both are nice. i am 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist.",Positive
Super comfortable and on trend with the embroidery and beading - wore it day after i received to the airport over tee shirt & jeans and got compliments left and right - love it!!,Positive
These run small. i normally wear 28 on ag stevie's and paige jeans so i ordered these in 28 and they were very tight. otherwise very well made and super cute but i had to return them.,Neutral
"I love these pants! super comfy - fit well and a great color. i knew immediately when i put them on that i would love them. and the button fly? to die for. 
wore them and they did stretch out a bit by the end of the day but they didn't look awful and super baggy. i bought the other color in a size smaller so they might be better. a great pant for summer!",Positive
"I really wanted this skirt to work but it didn't look very flattering on me. a great midi length and very cool pattern, so hopefully will work for others!",Neutral
"I was wondering whether to purchase this top and decided last weekend during the 20% off event, i would splurge!!! i got the m as i'm tall (5'10"") and it does look a little strange on the arms atleast on my body. the sleeve is cut too high for me. i wish it was longer or even a long-sleeved item! the peach-apricot- nude colored fabric is a little uncomfortable and the fabric close to the neck is a different grey from the other sweatshirt pieces. the sweatshirt pieces aren't particularly soft eit",Neutral
This skirt is very comfortable and fits tts or even runs a bit large. i was able to dress it up with a great white shirt and statement necklace. great find.,Positive
"I ordered these on sale despite a previous reviewer's comment that they were unflattering on the back side. they really do hug your bum, but that is not what bothers me. what bothers me is that the back side is totally see through, so unless you plan on wearing them with a long top, they are not wearable in public or around other people. i have gotten some of my favorite pieces from retailer, but also some of the most poorly designed. unfortunately, these fall in the latter category.",Neutral
"I love this jess. i got it in the blue gray color, and i think it's going to be great for spring and will work into summer as well. cloth and stone is always one of my favorite brands and this dress is so soft. i'm thinking that i'm going to belt it to give it some more shape but i like how it looks unbelted as well",Positive
No only is this a beautiful update to a basic white top it is incredibly soft. i couldn't pass it up and wish it came in more colors!,Positive
"This is a great dress from moving to summer into fall. it's great right now with the warm temps, but a throw on a jacket and some booties and you have a fall outfit. it's very comfortable also. there is a slip underneath which is what you see with the buttons open in the front. i wish the slip was a little longer and the dress is see through. maybe, you can adjust it at the straps some. at any rate, it's a nice dress and i'm keeping it.",Positive
"I bought the holly color which appears almost granite/slate color in natural light. overall, great transitional sweater piece for fall. i'm considering exchanging it for an xs since the s seems a bit large. comfy/cozy yet breathable.",Positive
"I typically wear a 26 or 27 in jeans, had to size up to a 28 in these. the legs felt fine in the size 27, but the waistband was a bit tight, so i went with the 28s. i am 5'2"" 115lbs. i'll also be hemming or possibly just cutting these off, they are about 4 inches longer on me compared to the model pictured.",Positive
"Interesting, slightly transparent fabric. neckline is not so open as pictured. body is boxier than pictured.
would recommend as a maybe.",Neutral
"I got so many compliments on this the first day i wore it. i think of this more like a sweater coat than a regular sweater. it is extremely soft and warm, but not bulky at all. it lays really neatly, which is why i think of it more like a coat. this will definitely be a staple moving into the winter and then into spring. keep in mind though that this does not button - they're just for show.",Positive
Like the style of a blazer but the fabric of denim. looking forward to pairing with dresses and black pants,Positive
"I love this cardigan! its fit, however, really depends a lot on an individual's height and build. i am about 150 lbs. i have slim arms and am larger in the chest. my typical size in retailer clothing is m. having said that, i found that in this top a s fit best. it made a difference with how the pockets and lapels lay. the pants you wear may affect the look when you snap it closed. wearing leggings or slim pants (ex. pilcro cords) gave a much more flattering look to my backside. jeans...not so muc",Positive
I really liked the design. ordered a medium which was huge. also thought i would not be able to tolerate it because of the material -- a bit itchy. returned it.,Negative
Fancy and fun. i love the green and the texture. shiny outside and soft inside. flattering fit and a little whimsical and dressy or casual.,Positive
I wore this dress to work with a tan pair of booties and the compliments started upon entry and did not stop till the end of the day. very feminine and comfy all at once.,Positive
"I bought this in june on a sale and am so glad that i did. it''s so pretty and classy. the neck has stretch so it's not tight at all. it's styled like a swing top, but it really isn't. there isn't much of a fabric abundance to this, although it is loose (and cool.) i bought an xl, which is my usual size and the fit is fine.

there are 2 layers of fabric. i do not think a cami is needed at all.

i bought this in black and the floral embroidery just pops! i'm just not a white fan due to cleani",Positive
"So this skirt is everything. the only downside is that it's not in a petite sizing so i'm going to have to get this altered (i'm 5'3). the sizing is appropriate (usually wear an 8 or 10 in pants and got a size medium for the skirt), the material is thick enough for spring or summer weather, the color is just right (not too light), the pockets are adorable and i feel like i'm channeling some 70's realness, sits higher on your waist, and is super comfortable. i know i'm going to get a lot of use o",Positive
"This dress looks great online with boots as shown. when it arrived and i tried it on, it fit great on my arms, wasn't too tight on my neck, but once it went down over my chest (36c), the dress never came back ""in"" to show my feminine waist/shape. it just looked like a big trash bag on me, very disappointing! similar to a mumu.",Negative
"I ordered this top in small petite but wished i had exchanged it for an xsp because it's wide in the arm holes. but i love it nonetheless and wear it with a cami underneath. i love that while it's sleeveless, the straps are wide. this type of wide top is not for well endowed women up top. i don't have that problem so it looks really cute. i also love the length. a lot of tops tend to be really long and for a petite person, shorter tops look best.",Positive
"I was excited to get this shirt in the mail, i liked the pattern a lot, but was so disappointed when i tried it on. i am 5'4"", 130 lbs. and wear a c cup so i tried ordering a small as a starting point. there was enough fabric on the sides to make another shirt! despite the excess fabric, the shirt pulled open in the chest area, making it a complete fail. i'm sure the model in the photo must have the shirt clipped in the back to pull in the excess fabric, especially since she's small on top. ther",Negative
"Love the print and was looking forward to this dress. the length and bust are just right in normal sizing, however the 'swing' effect is all off. there's so much fabric. its like wearing a moo moo. not at all flattering. disappointed in this one.",Negative
"The jacket runs large so size down. it's a good jacket to throw on the go. but i don't see this lasting long bc after he first wash, it started piling. the quality of the material isn't great!",Positive
Lovely dress. i did send it back only because the length was below my knee and i prefer slightly above the knee.,Positive
I am obsessed with peplum down coats because the ones you usually see have no shape and are extremely unflattering. i was excited for this to arrive. this is quite nice and it looks more feminine than the other down coats out there. the coat itself runs just true to my shirt size but not what i want for a coat. i will be returning this for a size up because i will want to wear a sweater or at least maybe a thicker shirt under this especially for winter or fall. the fabric is decent and the weigh,Positive
"I waited six weeks for this dress to arrive and was so disappointed. loved the skirt part of it. but the top, which i guess i didn't see in photo was pleated as well, made my bust look huge and it puffed out on sides. would have been a wonderful summer dress, flowing and cool.",Negative
"This just arrived today. the material is very soft and i love the olive color. it has a zipper in the back but i was able to easily slip this over my head, making me think it runs a bit large. because it is loose the fact that the drop waist hits right at the hip doesn't bother me, though i thought it would fall a little lower. i am only 5'2"" and i consider this to be a short dress. with thick leggings i think it will be great winter dress. the bodice is fully lined (the skirt is not) and the ne",Positive
"This jacket looked adorable on. it was also quite comfortable. however, it sheds and left fuzz on every dark surface it touched. sadly, this is a deal breaker for me.",Negative
"Loved the fabric of this dress, and the slip that comes with it. i wish the waist line fit a little better though. i am 5'4"" with an athletic build and it looked really boxy on me. i was so disappointed. thought i could synch it in to make it work, but think this is a return.",Positive
"I loved this dress in the photos and couldn't wait to try it on in person. the print varies from dress to dress and mine had noticeably much more cream color in it. i didn't mind too much but it didn't look like the dress the model is wearing. i bought the xxs petite which fit true to size. the v neck is a bit low for petite sizing but the length was perfect on my 5'2"" frame which was a plus. i agree with the other reviewers the fabric is cheap and feels cheap. not something i would expect from",Neutral
"I loved the design online but the sweater is bulky and boxy. i had chosen the cream with blue and now looking back at the other pictures of the beige/cream it represents it better. it made me look very wide. loved it online but it wasn't for me, returned it.",Negative
"I wanted to get a couple tops for date nights that went well with skinny jeans and this hit the mark! as mentioned before, this top is translucent and thus would recommend using a cami as well. however the embroidery is beautiful. i have not had it cleaned yet and thus cannot comment on the durability. can't wait to wear it out.",Positive
"Love the print, length, and cut. but the tie waist hangs in a weird way and seemed like it would stretch out and sag after a while. sad to return it.",Neutral
"Absolutely fantastic top, the cut is very flattering and the colors are gorgeous in the pattern (i also bought the white).",Positive
"As other reviewers have pointed out, the bum is not flattering. the pockets are wide and the fit sort of flattens you out. bummer. literally. too bad, i wanted these to work more than then coh's parker cropped. the coh's win. my wallet loses.",Neutral
"Great top to dress (further) up or down. it does, however, run large and the straps seem (too) long. if you are a petite you will not be able to wear a regular without alterations.",Positive
"Fabulous dress!
clip off the tags because they show through the lace on the back (you can see this on the back photo of one recent reviewer).",Positive
"Very soft, comfy, lightweight sweater. perfect for layering as the weather gets cooler. looks great with jeans or jean shorts.",Positive
Very flattering on. fitted on top with a loose swingy bottom. like most retailer tops it does run a little big. i would size down if between sizes. the material does seem a little fragile so i'm not sure how it will hold up. i like the look/fit enough that i may get a 2nd color.,Positive
This romper is adorable!!! i love the long sleeves!,Positive
"I was excited to see this offered by retailer because i have been looking for a light blue summer jacket or blazer that isn't a denim jacket and this seemed to fit the bill. i've ordered several cartonnier blazers in 00p, as early as 2013 and as late as spring 2015, and have been very happy with them. on the plus side i would say that the color is depicted accurately and it does seem like a high quality jacket. but while the shoulders and sleeves were a pretty standard fit for 00p, it was much too",Neutral
Saw this top online and hoped for the best. my hopes were rewarded! lovely lightweight summery top but i think with a cardigan it could be worn in the fall also. i asked 4 friends if they liked it and they all agreed it was very flattering so i decided it was a keeper. have worn it three times since purchasing and have received lots of compliments.,Positive
"This top is really pretty and nice quality. runs big - i went down a size, and its perfect. coloring is more subtle in person than in the photo.",Positive
"I purchased this top in the wine color and found it to be cute and comfortable. the sleeves are not tight which is nice, but it is very short and moving your arms away from our sides make this shirt look a little bit like a tent. the color is pretty and the button detail is nice.
overall good purchase, but i'm glad i got it on sale!",Positive
Great boho chic top. a bit over - sized but soft and love the colors!,Positive
I just picked this up in store the other day! i absolutely love it! it is so easy to throw on real quick for a cute outfit.,Positive
The dress is true to fit and very soft. you can dress it up or be casual with a denim jacket.,Positive
This shirt is so cute with the cutout stripes and it goes with everything. it's easy to wear and true to size. you can dress it up or dress it down. the fabric is soft but also light weight. i am so happy to own this classic piece.,Positive
"I agree with everything the other reviewer stated. this top is very billowy and runs large, it would be nice if i didn't have a chest! the other issue with this top is the macrame detailing is made more out of a satin like material and i wanted it to look closer to natural raw fiber. the pink is slightly more pink in person but it's not that far off. had to return.",Positive
"I'm 5' 0"" and 120 pounds. this top is beautiful. it's high neck is so flattering. a nice switch it up for us gals that are older and like neck coverage sometimes. i purchased a small and it is a little longer, but since it has elastic at the waist it's no problem. i will tuck it in my jeans and skirts. the arm holes are perfect. the as far as it being a lot of blouse, i didn't find that at all. but i am busty, 34c or d depending on brand of bra. the color is ivory. omits completely sheer, no lin",Positive
"Perfect sweater to throw on with anything. it is fairly thin, i wore a cami underneath. the sleeves and hem are rolled. you have to be careful and it can snag easily. happy with my purchase.",Positive
"I ordered this blazer so i could look more put-together for work, but still feel comfortable. it checks both of those boxes, (it's almost like a sweatshirt material with more structure) and has a great cut/style. my only word of caution is that i thought this jacket was white with blue stripes, but the white part is actually a light heathered gray. i think i would have preferred white, but i still like it enough to keep. got my normal size small, which fit great.",Positive
"I ordered 2 sizes to try for in store pickup. both were too large, so size down (i am 5'4"", 125 lbs and the s was too large in the neck and body, even though i generally wear things large). also, the collar was a hemmed flat collar, not the roll collar depicted. i reviewed that with the salesperson as well -- we were both at a loss to explain why, and the tiger embellishments were more orange, yellow and glittery on the ones i ordered.",Neutral
"I ordered this because the reviews were outstanding. i am returning it. although the embroidery looks fine on screen, in person it looks cheap and tacky. moreover, the high ruffled neck goes a step too far -- into over-the-top victorian cutesy.
overpriced, to boot.
obviously, mine is a minority opinion.",Negative
I agree with the other reviewer that the color of this top is more burgundy with purple undertones rather than a deep red like shown online. the fit was very boxy on me and it did not look flattering. i was not willing to to have it altered so i returned it.,Neutral
I am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40. i did not purchase this top.,Neutral
I always search each summer for a maxi dress and this is the winner this summed! i love the way it wraps. fits perfectly. i got a size medium and i am 5'5 34dd; the dress is long enough to wear with flats or heels. i recommend this!,Positive
"I got this shirt and loved it so much the first time i wore it. it swings well and is an easy basic that looks great. however, after i washed it the first time, it became clingy and stuck to me and doesn't lie right. it's such a shame because i was thrilled with this as an addition to my wardrobe!",Neutral
"I bought this tunic to wear as a swim cover-up, last minute. but it has become my go to for wearing over skinny jeans. the length makes it so versatile, great layering piece.",Positive
"These jeans are very unique thanks to the embroiding. would have perferred colorful embroiding though. they are boyfriend cut, but not slouchy. just a bit loose even around athletic legs. they run true to size, but have a lot of give. after wearing them for a a little bit i catch myself pulling them up a bit. if you want a snug fit and are between sized i would go down a size.",Positive
Does not say ribbed. did not want ribbed. would not have bought ribbed,Negative
"Great petite maxi! i'm 5'3 and it skims the top of my feet. soft, fits great and went right into my suitcase for my upcoming  trip. can dress up or down.",Positive
"Normally i would not have bought this color and print, it is just not a color that i usually wear. but after reading reviews i ordered it online. i love love this top. it looks good, is flattering, and is a very nice and different color. i wore it with berry leggings and love it. the top is very comfortable, can be worn with pants and leggings. the only issue i have is that since the jersey fabric is only at the back and not in the front, it pulls at the tummy section in the front and shows an o",Positive
"The fabric is so thin, i think this entire garment might actually fit in a normal-sized letter envelope. the problem is not going to be that the garment is see-through (which it is) - it's the fact that the super thin fabric is not silky, it's cotton-ey, and i suspect it will get ""stuck"" against the back of my shirt/pants while i'm wearing it and not drape nicely. i wonder if some tiny weights could be sewn to the bottom hem to keep it laying properly.....

however, i'm such a sucker for a pre",Positive
"I purchased the blouse in both the ivory and black. the black i decided to keep because it will go with anything. i was hoping the ivory blouse would work but it's thin and see through. if someone could please tell me where i could find a casual, white or ivory blouse that is not entirely see through i would greatly appreciate it!",Neutral
"This dress might be the most comfortable article of clothing i own, especially for the hot summers. it is attractively loose, and so light that you barely feel like you are wearing it. love it!",Positive
"I tried these on at the store and the fit was good, the length was even ok for me as a petite person. the fabric was substantial and mostly cotton, which i like. but i felt like the floral pattern drew too much attention to my thighs, so it wasn't ultimately something i felt i would wear. still a nice comfort piece if you are ok with a floral pattern on your lower half.",Positive
"I like how this jacket is very versatile. you can wear it to work, or play. it does have interesting detail on it, i kept it based on the price and those details. i have the olive color. the arms are a little tight.",Neutral
I tried this on in the store and almost considered buying it until i looked at the price tag. i think it's unique and interesting. i just don't think it's worth the $$$. the fabric is nothing special and the construction is not complicated enough to warrant the cost. i would consider it on sale. retailer has more interesting sweaters made with softer blends for a similar price - all things considered i don't think it's a smart purchase.,Positive
"It's a pretty, low-key, no fuss skirt. i prefer the ivory color because the details are more visible (there are different designs in the same hue). the zipper is very thick and sturdy, a bonus. size 2 regular fit me well, the hem falls right above my knees (i'm 5'2"", 26 waist, 36 hips), perfect for work and play. a touch of linen keeps the fabric cool for summer, but it doesn't wrinkle. for the price and the name like ""thera,"" i expect more flair to match its mediterranean name. for those who do",Positive
Beautiful pattern and shape! however i had to send it back! it is extremely see through and ran very small! i even sized up and it still pulled in the bust area! maybe someone with a smaller bust might fit them better!,Neutral
"I wasn't sure about these when i first took them out, but they are so cute! the fabric is super soft and skims the body/is not clingy. i got the black & the red. the red is more of a magenta, but i'm okay with that. i think these will be great in the fall and early winter too, under cardigans & light jackets. another bonus, they do not show a ton of cleavage, like a lot of tops out there. the arm holes are also very close to perfect. i hate how big the armholes are on tops that basically require",Positive
I just bought this top yesterday in the yellow. i can't wait until it warms up a little more to wear it. it's very comfortable and very cute. i did have to size down. i may get one of the other prints as well.,Positive
"This is very cute and well-made, but unfortunately for my coloring and hair, washed me out a bit. the attention to detail is fabulous and it is a great layering piece for spring. tts but definitely longer as is shown in picture on model.",Positive
"Never spent this much on a dress so it needs to be amazing for me to keep it.  i've never seen flannel patterns and colors like this. the details in the back are unique. but in the end, i decided to return because it's too long and although it fit fine in a size large it didn't look that great on me. the dress has an exaggerated drop waist that was too low for my short waisted frame. the fabric smells odd. i tried belting it but the pockets and back buttons created bulk.",Positive
"I love this dress! it's so comfy and flowy. i wore to an event and got many compliments on the color and design of the dress. i'm 5'5"" and weigh 150.",Positive
"Very very boxy design/cut. try on first or buy knowing you are 90% likely to return. beautiful skirt but if you don't have the right body type/measurements, will not flatter you at all.",Negative
"I love this dress! i bought the blue one and i love the designs. i recently had a baby so my body is still recovering so finding clothes is a bit difficult, but this dress looks awesome and it makes me feel like how i was before i was pregnant! it flows nicely and is super comfortable.",Positive
"I tried this dress on in the store and ended up ordering it online during the dress sale. it is extremely flattering and really accentuates the waist. it is very comfortable, and made of a nice, soft fabric. i am a 34a and it just barely reveals a tiny bit of cleavage so i don't find the neckline too low. i plan to wear it with tights and booties. i am 5' 4"" and the regular xs comes to a bit below my knees. going to enjoy wearing this lovely dress!",Positive
"I love charlie pants. i've bought a few in the past, and i've never been disappointed with quality, style, or fit. i love the side zip on these and the nice flat front as a result. i wish more pants were side zip- so much more flattering than having that part stick out under fitted shirts. i got these in a 4, my usual size, and while they fit a little more snugly than my other size 4 charlie pants, there is enough stretch that they don't look or feel too tight. i also got these in the regular, r",Positive
"I decided to go shopping at my local co store and as soon as i walked in, i saw this skirt but it was used  as a top with green cropped summery pants on a mannequin. one of the lovely salesgirls decided she liked it better that way after she tried it as a top herself.  i tried it as well and love it as a top! she was small framed and my height and told me she sized up for comfort and she was correct. if used with a strapless bra, your regular size ( mine is a small) will be uncomfortable. howeve",Positive

"In general, if you were a fan of the turtleneck swing dress, you'll love the overall fit (tts) and fabric of this. the patterns/colors are also great! my issue was the armholes...they are a bit too large and the opening comes a little too far forward which makes it a little unflattering in the underarm area. i may reconsider when it goes on sale, but it's a pass for now.",Positive
"Perfect dress for the hot late summer/early autumn weeks! this beauty is flowy and rich in color. the tie back is adjustable which i love due to my weight fluctuations. because of the tie, length can be adjustable too! i'm short so the decision lies on what shoes i want to wear and how high i want my hem. this dress looks cute belted or with my cropped moto jacket thrown on top. all in all, i really like this dress and i see it staying in my closet for a long while if the horrid viscose construc",Positive

it is cute though!",Negative

"I am ever in search of a light, white, summer top. this is not quite it. there are two distinct layers, and each of them is the scratchy, starchy type of gauze. it would just roast me in the summer sun--but i run fairly hot in general.",Neutral
I found this today on the one and only rack. i absolutely fell in love with it. i bought my normal size medium and it fit perfectly. other customers were asking where they could find it in the store. i highly recommend. it can be dressed up or down.,Positive

"Everything about this dress is perfect for my body type.  i used the tie belt as a cinch to gather the fabric and made the silhouette into a loose fit & flare.  i have a large upper body and small lower half so maybe the excess fabric balances out my body but looks terrible on other shapes.  i am 36dd 140# 5'3"" and i purchased the medium petite.",Positive
"Look closely and you will be surprised at this awesome print!  the shirt is very soft and comfy.  be warned that it runs huge.  i usually wear a medium or large in this brand.  after many tries, i ended up with a small and it is roomy.  this looks so cute under a jacket too.",Positive
"Just a warning. i am always a 6 or 8 and even the 8 was so tight in the waist i could barely out this on. if you don't have a super tiny upper waist, this won't fit well. too bad, because it's super cute, if a bit sheer.",Neutral

"I so badly wanted this top to work. it looks so cute! but, as soon as i tried it on, i knew it wasn't a keeper. i didn't even need a mirror! it's not suited for those of us with a bust (i'm a 34d) and anything but a lanky model-esque frame. i suggest sizing up if you're busty and want to give it a try. it looked dowdy on me.",Neutral
"I bought this shift dress for a ""black & plaid"" nye event, and it fit the bill perfectly for a cold winter's night. looks great with tights and boots, has pockets, and dresses up nicely. i like a good shift at this point in the holiday season -- leaves room for that last bit of seasonal eating and drinking. looking forward to wearing this through the winter months.",Positive

i'm usually a size 12 and this fit true to size.",Positive
"This is really one of those items that hits it out of the park. first, the fit is great. it's relaxed without being oversized or tapering way out or way in or something odd like that. it's nearly universally flattering to most body types and it's easy to wear with nearly anything. shorts, jeans, trousers, pencil skirts.....it looks great dressed up or down. 

i also like that the pleats that create the ruffle are sewn nicely (sometimes my recent purchases from retailer have not been the best qua",Positive
"First problem-i would not have ordered this at all had the description been correct. the fabric description is cotton which the dress is most certainly not. secondly, it has a really funky, cheap, unfinished, raw-hemmed slip which is simply not fitting for the dress. the keyhole in the front is super long-again, does not seem to fit the dress. i am not happy with this piece at all but it did fit tts. length is just above knee. i am 5'5"" 142 lbs 34d and the six was a good fit. sending this home t",Negative

"I am still in love with my ribboned denim dress from earlier this year. so, when i saw this dress i was super excited and ordered it right away in the same size. it just came and... i'm kinda disappointed. the fit is... shrunken?? kind of like i'm wearing a petite size. it's around 3 to 4 inches shorter, the tie at the waist hits instead right under my bust, and there's some weird bunching happening above my rear?? i kept wanting to pull the whole dress down more, but that's just the way it was",Positive
Light and distinctive design. the fabric seems somehow synthetic and in very warm weather might become not so fresh,Positive
This material is a nice quality but the shirt is boxy and shapeless. it was not flattering at all on my shape. i don't think it would look nice on anyone with an hourglass shape or fuller chest.,Negative
"I bought this in the neutral motif and my expectations before trying it on weren't high but i was sold once i was in the dress. sometimes dresses that have the elastic band in the waist can be tricky if you don't have a perfectly flat tummy and can accentuate the tiniest bump. however, this dress sits perfectly on the waist and is actually super slimming. i wasn't 100% sold on the pattern or color (i wish it was more off white than brown) but the fit was so great that i had to buy it! the dress",Positive

"The colors and fabric on this dress are really pretty. the lace is a soft blue instead of white. i have other dresses like this from this brand and really wanted to keep it, but it runs larger than the others i have. also, it doesn't have pockets. if it fits you properly, i think you will love it!",Positive
I tried this on in store in a small and then ordered the medium online i loved it so much! i generally run a small/medium with retailer so i thought this was pretty true to size. i'm also longer through the torso so the medium is better for me to cover my stomach when tied.  it is on the thinner side but not see through. perfect for layering and for a mild california winter. can't wait for it to come!,Positive
"This dress is sure to become one of my favorites! i ordered it online and the colors are even prettier in person; very vivid! it is a little light for the climate where i live right now but, i'm sure that as soon as it gets a little warmer i will be wearing it often. i can't wait!",Positive
"I wore this dress for this first time today, and it is a head-turner. sure to be a new favorite! i received several compliments while out running errands. the dress is flattering to my hourglass shape (i tied it in the back). it is not at all clingy; it flows nicely. the top of the dress is bra-friendly and not too low cut. i am 5'8"" and found the length to be just right for me; the medium skims the tops of my feet, and i wore the dress with flat sandals. unlike another reviewer, the dress i rec",Positive
This is a nice shirt and very flattering. the ivory is actually more of a tan/brown- i would not call it ivory or off white. the material has a nice texture to it as well. it does run big and long so keep that in mind when purchasing.,Positive
You have to be a contortionist to get this bra on. it slips over your head and i needed my 8yo daughter to help me pull it down past my elbows. ridiculously impractical. why oh why didn't heather give it a hook and loop closure instead?,Negative
This dress is beautiful on so many levels. the colors and print are amazing and the maxi sweater dress idea is unique. it fits true to size and is very flattering. my only issue is the amount of shine that it has from the metallic threads running through it. i would have preferred less shine which would make the dress more versatile.,Positive
These shorts are really cute but i felt like they were a little too short for me so i ended up returning them and i purchased the dress by the same brand instead.,Positive
"This top is beautiful in the model shot, but average in person. it ran really small, i usually take a medium in retailer tops and ordered this in a medium. it barely fit over my chest, and was pretty short (i am 5'7""). also, the material is very thin, not so much that you can see your undergarment, but if you get cold everyone will know it. also, for the price, i expected a sturdier fabric. i would recommend holding out for sale, if you are interested in this top.",Neutral

"I was very disappointed by the fit of this top. it is quite short (especially in the back) and very wide. i did not find it flattering. on a positive note, the fabric is nice and thick - very warm layering piece for fall. for sizing reference, i'm 5'5'', 122 lbs, and took my usual size xs.",Negative

"This is a cute, fun addition to my wardrobe, especially since i am a polka dot fan! it is alittle short for me and i think it runs just a bit small, particularly if you want to wear like the model with longer shirt under it. overall, it was worth the sale price and will look good with casual pants, jeans and with dressier black pants for work.",Positive
I'll start this by saying i usually wear a m or l depending on the shirt. i'm 20 weeks pregnant and ordered a medium. it's huge! i was thinking i would be able to wear this for a bit while preggo and then would be able to wear it after baby with no problem. i'm going to order a small because the fabric is so soft and i love the design and color.,Positive
"I really love this dress. it runs very true to size and is nice and long, but could be easily hemmed. i am 5'10' and have room for heels. the waist runs just slightly high and causes a slight flare out of the fabric at the hips but it is not a deal breaker. the cotton is super light weight and perfect for summer. some jersey fabric maxi 's can be super hot. i was surprised by the cost for the actual quality of the dress.",Positive
This has a classic tunic style silhouette with delicate gold threads. it looks even better in person than online.,Positive
"This shirt is easy, breezy, comfy, and stylish - everything i want as a busy mom. all the patterns are beautiful it i went with the blue motif as well as the floral print because they felt fun and easy to wear with jeans or white pants. this definitely fit a full size large for me. i tried my usual s plus xs thinking the shoulders might be too tight, but the xs was perfect. happy to have this beauty in the rotation!",Positive

This jacket is well-made and smart looking. it gave me just the boost i needed today at a difficult meeting. thank you retailer!,Positive
I bought this dress for my bridal shower and it is perfect. the pattern is beautiful and very similar to the image shown online. the fabric is much lighter than i anticipated which is nice for spring/summer weather. i had to get the top altered slightly to better fit on top but it was a very easy alteration. i am normally a size 8 in dresses and found this to fit very true to size.,Positive
This skirt is stunning but i really wish it was cotton canvas - maybe by summer retailer could make one?,Positive

I had eyed this simple yet stylish dress for awhile but hadn't tried it on yet. i managed to snag the orange version during the tag sale - $40 for maeve?? it is super flattering and will be a wardrobe staple for years.,Positive
"I hesitated initially buying this because of the unique fit in the neckline and shoulders and because i have broad shoulders. but if you adjust the neck, sleeves and play with the overall fit of the shirt, it works. the boxy airy design has to be paired with something that flows with it (i.e. linen pants) or trusty denim. otherwise you may have a battle on your hands finding a complementary pairing!",Positive
"What a great, soft piece for fall.  the top is flattering and comfy at the same time. it looks really romantic with the bare shoulder look.",Positive
I like that the top is lightweight and very comfortable and is flattering. i can see wearing this over the holidays for entertaining. it looks festive and pretty - something easy to pop on and look pulled together in a flash.,Positive

The front and back materials differ. the back of the shirt is soft and thin. the front embroidery is stiff but i imagine it will soften after a wash. pretty shirt though.,Positive
"This was a sleeper hit for me! it was on sale for a great price so i thought...what the heck! interesting diagonals in how the skirt is pieced together and i totally felt like a sexy mermaid! the only downside was that it was so long! i'm 5/2"" and expect things like this to be long but wow. luckily it was easy to shorten without loosing the cute flare at the bottom. i'm 135lbs and the medium fit snug but not trampy. i could have probably worn a large too but i don't plan on tucking my shirt into",Positive
I loved this sweater when i bought it. wore it a couple times then washed it according to the tag. it shrunk at least two sizes! and the tassels got all tangled (which i guess i should have seen coming). pretty bummed about it because this sweater looked beautiful on.,Neutral
"So gorgeous! the details make this tank so special! the subtle sequin around the neckline are just enough to make this a dress-up or dress-down top. perfect with skinny jeans for an evening date night or a black cardigan for the office. the fabric is soft -- almost like a very light weight knit sweater, but so light that you can wear it for summer.",Positive

pros:
- it is well made and on the thicker side.

This dress was a gamble for a nautical them wedding next year. could not be happier. fabric was surprisingly stretchy which made it move like butter. the dress was stunning on and very comfortable which cannot be said for many gowns. i am so glad i took the gamble.,Positive

"This top is really pretty. it's a very strong embroidered lace all over (front and back) with small holes. but, the description states there is a polyester lining, and this is unlined! so,there are holes. but, i do not think this is immodest and needs a cami. just wear a nude bra under it. the holes are not revealing at all.

"This is an adorable top, but it just wasn't my style. i'm 40 and felt silly wearing a big bow, but if you can rock this look i'd recommend it. the top is a thin sweatshirt material, not a knit sweater or a thick sweatshirt fabric. it is a cotton rayon blend. the sweatshirt part is cropped, but the striped shirt details come to a good length. the shirt trim is 100% cotton. the fit was true to size. it is a bit loose, not overly fitted, but true to size. it nips in a bit at the waist and then flar",Positive
"I didn't think from the photo online that the sweater would be quite so sparkly & gold! it has gold weaved in - so if the sparkly isn't your thing, beware. the sweater fit well although i didn't feel the neckline was quite as clean as in the photo above. also, you'd have to be careful not to snag on jewelry. it's a thin sweater material that may require a camisole underneath depending on the weather.",Positive
"This very lightweight and semi-sheer dress fits like a midi dress on my height. the back hem ends low calf and the front hem is below knee. straps are adjustable and bodice edge is elasticized. the print is pretty and can pair with any sweater or jacket or jewelry or shoes that hits your fancy. my concern is regarding the 100% rayon fabric and how it will hold up after cleaning as all of my 100% rayon clothing from *random fast fashion retailer* does not last long. i'm 5'3"" 140# 39-28-35 and hap",Positive

I'm so glad i trusted my instincts and decided not to size down on this luxurious dress since my body type is so different from the previous reviewers.  size small would have surely cut off my circulation around my shoulders.  i bought mp since i have thick arms/shoulders/back and i'm short 135# 38-27-35.   my only gripe is how skinny and insubstantial the straps are so maybe i'll get those changed.  i'm tempted to buy the other color since this dress is so beautiful but i really don't nred it!,Positive

"The first thing i noticed upon receiving this dress is how soft it is and the fact that it wasn't wrinkled coming out of the packaging bag- an excellent quality! my next surprise was to find that it is fully lined with a very nice soft knit and felt awesome on. i ordered a size small and it fit perfectly- it was fitted through my waist and hips (37 chest, 28.5 waist, 37 hips) and dropped straight from my hips just like i like. i was afraid it would be too sheath like for my figure but it is perf",Positive
"This top is soft feeling and i appreciate that it's lined. it's light weight and feminine, but no camisole is needed. when you take it off the shoulder area feels tight, so you need to be a little gentle but it's gorgeous and you should get it. i'm a 32c and i got a 2.",Positive
I really loved this dress. it ran small but it was also shorter than i imagined which was only worsened because i'm curvier on top. would be great for slender figures.,Neutral
I love the color and shimmer of this dress. it is very unique and one of a kind. the slit is not as high as the photo online but that can be adjusted if need be at a tailor. it's a great dress!,Positive
I liked the color of this top but i didn't really like the ruffled stitching around the middle. it looks like someone just tacked on the bottom half. i bought this for my daughter and she likes it. i think it is comfortable and a good top to knock around in.,Neutral

"This dress is quite lovely, but there are a few things to know:

the blue color is much more of a dark teal, with more of a dull green tinge than i expected. still pretty, but definitely not a pure blue. i loved the look of the blue online, but i think the pink might have worked a little better with my coloring.

"But, it just doesn't measure up. first, the slip/lining comes unattached if pulled slightly and it is very difficult to actually get it on - either stepping into it or pulling it over your head. and, once on, the top was a big snug and there was too much material at the bottom which made it look really bulky. unfortunately, i am finding this to be the case with so many of the items i buy from retailer lately. the material is really cute, but the dress isn't worth the price / effort.",Negative
Love this top! the material is very comfortable and it's loose fitting which is what i was looking for!,Positive
"I got to try this on today and i really like it. the fabric is a normal t-shirt kind of fabric (i was hoping it would have been kind of special) and the v-neck in the front does go down a ways so that some cleavage is showing. i would feel comfortable wearing it as-is outside of work, but would have to pair it with a cami if i would going to wear it to work. normally, i am not a huge fan of v-neck in the back and it drives me crazy thanks cami's these days are often made with a ""versatile"" v and",Positive

I love this top. it looks exactly like the picture except the sleeves are not full length; they are closer to 3/4 length. the color is vibrant and the material is light and comfortable.,Positive
"I fell in love the first time i saw it. the xs is the perfect fit. i generally wear xs/s or 2 in dresses. its not too snug to wear over a thin to medium thickness sweater. its a good length also, not too long, which i struggle with given my height of 5'3. the s was overall too big. its not itchy, though i've only worn it with long sleeve tops. its just the right weight. not too thin and not too heavy. its feminine and fun. wonderful topper for jeans, pants, or a dress. the color is versatile. sl",Positive

I purchased the stripped blouse and it was very large around the armhole. it bulged open as if it needed a dart. i even washed it to see if it would shrink to fit and it was better but not good enough. i hate my bra showing through the armhole. it's going back. cute blouse except for that. i love sleeveless blouses with turtlenecks.,Neutral

"This is a great pull over dress that can easily be dressed to wear to work, to a bbq, or to happy hour. i have a large chest which sometimes makes this fit look like a tent but this fabric drapes nicely. the only thing i would note is the neckline was slightly higher on me than for the model.",Positive
"I'm 6 ft tall and usually wear a size 10/12, but had to size up to a 14 because this dress runs a bit small around the waist. it's a beautiful dress. it hit me right below the knee, so might be long on shorter gals. i received many compliments on this dress. the colors are beautiful. the main color of the dress is a dark navy. it looked black online. definitely buy this dress! it's a great work dress and you won't be sorry that you did.",Positive

"Comments. the detail is lovely - especially the dragonflies on the sleeve. and the quality is there with the lining. trouble is this is thick fabric cut in a box shape. imo, you have to be very skinny to pull this off and not look like a tank. i looked at the model (after purchasing) and notice that she has it open and swept back a bit bc if it is not, it is terribly unflattering.",Negative
"I love this top. the seam does go across the bustling but if you are small chested like me...it is perfect. very bohemian and an almost classic look with a very contemporary twist. there are splits up the side that show off a great pair of leggings. i wore this today with some lysee black and grey patterned leggings, a long grey camisole, and some cute short free people booties...i may have gotten 20 compliments. love it.",Positive
These are my favorite flare jeans! they have that lovely 70's style and go with everything and look great all year round. the fit is perfect. my all time favorite jeans.,Positive
"While i love the fabric and the pattern, this skirt leaves too much to be desired. the full price is absurd considering what you get.
there is no mention online that there is no built in slip, and as the material is extremely thin a slip is an absolute must. (see attached photo.) even in dim lighting you can see straight through. 
also for this price point it is strange that the skirt is 'pull-on styling.' i would say that it is true to size, and i am usually a medium @ retailer, but i have a sm",Negative

"I bought these assuming they would be the same as a pair of pilcro stet ankle jeans i bought a couple of years ago. this pair has less stretch than my older ones, so they are a bit tighter. i'm 5'2"" and these are more like a perfect length regular jean (rather than ankle). i always have trouble finding jeans that fit my curves, but smaller waist. these are a bit big in the waist, with the butt and legs fitted. all-in-all they are a nice looking durable denim that flatters.",Positive

it is a bit tough to get the right fit in this top, depending on your preference. i usually wear a size 2-4 in tops (26"" waist, 34b/c), but went with a 0 in this because it just felt wide otherwise. also, i am fine with it, but this blouse seems to be somewhat short in the torso. if you are particular, possibly buy in store because the pattern of bees varies quite",Positive

"I fell in love with this dress when i saw it. i am usually a petite, so i knew it would hit me just above the ankle, but it works! what is lacking from the description is the under slip that comes with the dress. it is a knee length, cotton jersey slip that is bulky and uncomfortable - thus the 4 star rating instead of 5 star. i won't use the slip, so this makes the dress fairly sheer when backlit. otherwise, the dress is well made and the addition of the piping at the seams makes it special. i",Positive

"After reading the glowing reviews i was excited to buy this on sale. i'm tall and lean, but found the dress looked slightly awkward and off on me compared to the model pictures. firstly, the top has a strange transition to the skirt, with extra fabric you have to either blouse over the skirt or bunch together. if you blouse it and lay flat, it invariably gets bunched as you wear it. this bunching changes the aesthetics of the color blocks, creating less clean lines. i also found the blue, black",Negative

"Saw the grey one on the table at my local retailer. first thing i did was touch it to feel if it's soft and it felt like butta. surprisingly, it's a very snuggly and warm sweater despite it not being very thick. i think the grey is conservative enough for the office and it goes with pretty much everything, yet the geometric shapes make it modern and interesting looking. i hate turtleneck (choke!) and big cowl neck (reminds me of the 80's), but this is a compromise of both which is a bonus. since i",Positive

"This is one of my favorite tops! i have it in two colors. it's almost like a swing look, yet it still feels like it gives me a shape to my body. very easily paired with a skinny jean. i paid full price for th two, but now i'm sure i'll buy the third on sale!",Positive
"When i spotted this online i just knew it was a 'must have'. holding horses brand usually runs big on me, but this is a more fitted top. i ordered the size 4 & 6 so i cld compare. well, the 4 is a little snug in the bust area & the bodice seam falls high across the mid-bust area. except for that the fit is good. being cotton i realize it will probably shrink some when washed so i don't think the 4 works for me. the size 6 is much looser overall & the fit is much better in the bust area. the armh",Positive
"This top is beauitiful. gorgeous detailing with the eyelet lace, black flower appliquã©s, silver beads and tiny rose gold sequins down the front. true to size. i'm 5'2"", 130 lbs, 34b and took my usual size 4. the slits do come up a bit far on the sides like another reviewer noted but not really enough to be a problem. i didn't find it necessary to get the petite size in this top. i was going to wait until further markdown since the top is still pricey even with a 20% discount but couldn't resist",Positive

Love this coat! beautiful pattern and thick enough to keep you warm with a lining inside. i am short so i got the petite and it fits perfectly in the arms and overall length. i read other comments about the button being too low but i didn't find this to be true. i liked the lower button as it allows you to show some of what you have underneath.,Positive
"I ordered the cream. the fabric is unique. similar to a waffle but with a dressy quality. you definitely need a cami or tank underneath. its form fitting without being too snug. i like to wear it with distressed jeans, front tucked in and kind of ruched to hide my middle, (my trouble spot) with chunky accessories, belt, necklace and a block heel. it's a little pricey but decided worth it.",Positive

"This is a cute, flattering dress, however the drop-waist, the short length and the odd-length sleeves (shorter than shown in the photos!!!) added up to me feeling like i was dressing way to young. it just didn't convey an elegant, mature vibe. this dress is perfect for a 20s-30s woman who wants a versatile dress to wear on many occasions. it's great because it's not too expensive and you could wear it with any type of shoes.

my big problem is the lack of transparency regarding the actual slee",Neutral

This product is perfect for early fall wear. when the weather is a little cooler a shell worn under it will be fabulous,Positive
"This is a great basic tee (purchased in navy) but fits much larger than it appears on the model. the arms/chest area fit fine but it really billows out below. the front is shorter and the back is longer than i would've expected. i thought this would be great for summer, but it's really too long in the back to wear with shorts. it does, however, look great with skinny jeans.",Positive
"I waited and got this sweater at the winter sale. i ordered the navy in a medium. the design is pretty, but as has been said, i was surprised at how short it is. i do love the detail, the tie back. nice weight. i have not found it to be itchy. the sweater i received was a store return, and it was a little wrinkled and fuzzy, but for $35 i considered my hunt for the perfect navy pullover to be over. i do need to wear a cami underneath, as the sides are more revealing than pictures. the first day",Neutral
"I was so surprised to find this in the sale. it is beautiful. light and airy while lined. the color is bright and fun. it is so comfortable. i ordered an xs based on reviews (this is my typical size in this type of style) and it fit great. i ordered the regular length even though i am only 5'4"". i am about 120#. will be an easy ""go to"" skirt to throw on for a casual look or can be dressed up. did i mention comfortable?",Positive
"I love this unique piece. it is slightly over sized which is intended - cinches allow you to tighten the waist area/providing more definition. will look great with booties in the fall.. great boho dress.. the included slip runs small and short. however, if it's a piece you love, you could easily wear a different slip if you wanted something a little longer.",Positive

Very nice top. flattering and goes with everything. i bought the medium in the green but would have needed the large in the white as the white was a little see through and showed more of my flaws. i agree with the other reviewer in that this top has good button placement.,Positive
This sweater is quite lovely. the yarn is light and delicate and the sweater is over all very feminine and figure flattering. i bought the light red color which is quite attractive and i'm not usually a fan of reds and pinks. this sweater can be worn casually with jeans or more dressed up for the office. anyone that is looking for a sweater that can be worn with almost anything should defiantly consider this one.,Positive
"Comfy, cozy, and great bargain for the sale price.",Positive

This is a great dress; good quality fabric. the pattern & color are spot on. the silhouette is divine & would work on many body types. i also love the length!,Positive
The top of this suit was not proportioned well. i am normally a 34c so with swimsuits i vary between a small or a medium. the cup size on this was very small for a medium. the band to hook in the back was almost too big. there was no way to adjust the band in the back and the cups were clearly too small for a c cup. the print was darling but unfortunately this will have to go back.,Negative
"I hate buying dresses because i rarely find one that fits well. i'm very petite on top (xsmall) and small/med on bottom, 5'8"". usually dresses are tight on my hips & thighs and loose up top. this fairly lightweight yet warm dress is such a winner! form-fitting yet stretchy and forgiving in all the right places. the x-small and small both fit pretty well but i decided to go with the x-small on this one. i think this will be a staple winter/fall dress. loved the fit so much i bought it in the peac",Positive

This is a really pretty print on a decent top. the only reason i returned is because it didn't look good with my skin tone and the fabric is thin. i'd planned to use it as a later under cardigans.,Positive
"These are my first pair of mother denim and certainly not the last. they fit true to size. i am a 26 in designer denim such as j brand, paige, ag. i bought these in a size 26 and they fit perfectly. they hug my curves nicely. i am 5'3 so they bunch up just a little bit at the ankles which i can easily have altered, but honestly don't need it. the quality is great - nice denim material with a lot of stretch to it. i love my skinny jeans tight and these were exactly what i was looking for!",Positive

This shirt is unflattering and boxy. it does not look cute at all on me. i am returning.,Negative
One can't tell from the picture but the top shoulder part is sheet and transparent. it also is very long almost dress length.  feels less quality than what retailer usually carries.,Negative
I love this tee. really comfortable and super cute too!,Positive

"I'm being eyeballing this dress for quite a while, finally i decided to jump on it and i was so ansy to receive it in the mail, finally arrived and some how wasn't what i was expecting, the front part has 2 pieces of fabric attached to the sides of the dress that wrap around your waist making that effect you see on the model. to be honest i didn't like that at all, i think they ruined the dress with that, the dress is very comfortable feeling, the fabric is super soft i can imagine wearing this",Positive
"This dress is truly a no brainer purchase! it is a stunning dress with gorgeous embroidery, beading and  the color is just perfect for fall! i am only 5'2 and i went with the regular size since i don't like to go too short. that said, you can totally rock this dress with leggings and boots if it is too short. i weigh 103 lbs and i am normally an xxs but i'm glad i went with the xs since it would have been too tight at the top and should even  be slightly loose fitting on the bottom. love everyth",Positive

"I usually wear a medium or large in retailer clothes. i purchased this in a large and it fit perfectly. it is a clingier top but i didn't find it too much so. the ribbing makes it very attractive and slimming, and also can be worn as a stand alone turtleneck or easily as a layered piece. it is super soft and comfy as others have mentioned, and a tad thicker than just a cotton turtleneck would be - it has substance. also, it would be great for traveling because it doesn't wrinkle at all. love that!",Positive

"Just purchased this in the lilac color in the store in my usual xs size. the cut and shape are very flattering, with the waist sitting lower than my natural waist. in person, the color looks very different than on the website. it is more a lovely neutral taupe to me. one thing is that the snap at the neck is placed about one half inch off in order for the neckline to lay flat. since this jumpsuit is so cute, i decided that this is an easy fix i can do myself.",Positive

This top caught my eye right away and i had to have it! i am obsessed with everything off the shoulder and this is a great transition piece to wear that off the shoulder look well into fall. i was expecting the fabric to be a little lighter and i did't realize there would be a ribbed texture to the fabric. the shirt is also very long and i feel as though it runs large. that being said it looks super cute on and i intend to style it just as shown in these pictures with zipper accented skinny jean,Positive

"This is the perfect grab and go t-shirt. i love the fun design as it takes a simple t-shirt and makes it fun. i originally ordered the small but it was way to big for me especially at the waist. the bottom half of this top is much looser and if you want to have a more fitted look, size down. very cute.",Positive

This is a beautiful casual top...it is a loose fit that is generously sized so instead of my usual large i purchased the medium for a better fit...the length is perfect not too long or short! the colors coordinate great with denim!,Positive

"Love this denim jacket (also have it in white) the reason i didn't give it 5 stars all around is the distressing is just a bit too much (none on the back which is kind of strange). i'd love it even more if it wasn't distressed at all, then it could be dressed up much more for work. but overall it's my favorite, great fit and a bit of stretch so very comfy. please make this in some other denim colors!",Positive
"I really like this skirt but unfortunately there is no lining, so it's a bit see through under the light. also there is no hook at the top of the zipper to secure the skirt. i just think that with this kind of price, the skirt should come at least with the lining. otherwise, it's beautiful skirt, flowy and very feminine.",Neutral

"I decided to take advantage of the free shipping despite seeing no reviews yet. i received the dress today and it is exactly as pictured, only about 3 inches shorter. i am usually between an xs and s but chose the xs because of late, everything i seem to order is huge. this was an exception and i could have ordered the s. color was as pictured, a nice green. fabric was a gauzy cotton. the dress was just ""alright"". nothing special to warrant the price tag. it felt like a little girl's dress on me",Neutral

This runs really big. i usually wear s or m so i got a small but i need the xs in this top and it is sold out. i don't have a store close by (about an hour away) and i hate paying shipping for returns! i will either have to plan a trip to the store or try to exchange for size over the phone. i debated keeping the small but it is really too big .... i love the style though!,Neutral
"If you look closely at the pattern it is a giant triangle running across the front of your body. this doesn't do great things really if you have more of an hourglass shape or small waist. it completely removed the idea that you have a small waist and draws attention to the area of the triangle that is the largest. also, i agree with another reviewer about being cautious about buttons, as several were off some of the dresses.",Neutral
"I loved the actual design on the fabric. the flowers are gorgeous and i was really looking forward to wearing them, but the fabric was much too thin for me. i was surprised because another review said they were thick. to me, it felt like tights material, almost. however, they were not see through, which is great. overall, they just didn't look great on my body. 5'9"" size 6/8 curves, medium was a bit too loose.",Neutral
"I passed this sweater a few times during a recent visit to retailer. after striking out on several items i thought would work, i grabbed this sweater in the cream color. i loved it as soon as i put it on! it is meant to be oversized, which i love. the neck is chunky and looks good open or buttoned all the way to make a loose turtleneck. looks great with skinny jeans and booties. i went with my usual xs. great purchase!",Positive
Love this top! it is super flattering with a long floaty body. i usually wear a 4 but sized up to a 6 due to the reviews and am happy with it but think a 4 would have fit as well.,Positive
"I probably should have gone with petite. this dress was just awful on. the waist was nowhere near where it was supposed to be. it hits me about thigh level. it's very unforgiving, clingy, and shows every bump. i found the material tolerable but if worn for long periods of time, i have a suspicion that it would begin to irritate my skin and be scratchy. it's going back.",Negative
"This skirt looks very nice in person and it hugs one's cure beautifully. the hem is uneven which makes it more interesting. i am 5'2"", 120lbs, tried it in the navy/beige color in size s and size xs, and i found size xs fits better. the fabric is soft and stretchy, and it drapes well. because i am petite, the length of the normal size fits me more like a maxi skirt (it goes all the way down to my mid calf). unfortunately, the petite xs is sold out, so i have to settle with the normal size xs. sti",Positive

Highly recommend this top. received lots of compliments on the day that i wore. recommend wearing with a tank top.,Positive
"I adore this sweater. it is so soft and cozy. i ordered two because i really need some good winter sweaters that are forgiving on the pooch but not wool (darn allergies). so i ordered this in the white and black (camel is a bad color for me).

tried on the first sweater when they arrived and it was so comfy i didn't want to take it off. then i looked in the mirror. i'm a tall gal, 5' 11"" with broad shoulders and i weigh about 165, and this sweater was so unflattering! it just made me look big",Positive

"These are a nice option if you want crops that are shorter than the typical mid-calf length, but you don't want short-shorts. they hit right at the knee, so the length makes them cool and comfortable for summer. i wanted them to run errands, walk my dogs, and generally to just hang out. they'll be nice when traveling too.

"This fabric is the same as the turtleneck swing dress by maeve. it's lightweight and stretchy. the problem with this particular dress is the pattern in the fabric will be a little different on each dress depending on how the pattern was cut when it was made. i had to try on 5 different dresses to find one that was cut so the pattern looked and fell in the right spots when wearing the dress. hence 4 stars. the bodice is lined but the skirt itself is not. it is not see through. i'm 5'4"" and 120#.",Positive
"Frustrated that the details don't mention there's a side zip. for whatever reason, i have the hardest time fitting into dresses with side zips and so i was annoyed that the details say it's a pull-on style when that's not the case. there's also no give in the waist. besides the fit not working for me, it was a pretty dress but overall a little too much going on.",Neutral
"Love this dress - ""swingy"" is definitely the right descriptor. as someone with a large chest i was worried it would be boxy and make me look larger, but the cut is flattering even if it is on the loose size. it runs slightly large so if you're between sizes i would size down.",Positive
"Love, love, love this top. it is everything i hoped it would be. i liked that it could be worn up or off the shoulder. what made me fall in love were the colors. quality is excellent as usual. it is quite full in bodice, however it's only an xs. i do best with xxs tops.",Positive
"I gulped when i put this in my bag during retailer days because the price was still too much but thought this has to be wonderful to charge so much, right? boy was i wrong. this is a sweater knit with a very deep v-neck that's incredibly boxy and unattractive. the knit shed all over my pants in the few minutes i had it on. i ordered in xl, having never tried this designer and that was a mistake because i generally wear large or medium. it was swimming on me. the stripes aren't as cute in real life",Negative
"I purchased this vest in the store. the colors vary depending on where it is sewn - i purchased one with black around the middle, and more black around the collar (it was more flattering). the fit and design are lovely. it's fuzzy, but since i don't have any 'fur' in my wardrobe, this is a nice ease into that part of fashion for me. i highly recommend it, even for the price.",Positive
"I always have to try on tops of retailer. i know this, and yet i ordered a top through the website anyway. i don't think i'll do it again. the drape of the top seen in the pictures did not translate in real life because the top scratched up pretty quickly. ironically, when i washed it (according to directions) it also shrunk quite a bit.",Neutral
This skirt for sure was the most disappointing thing i've ever ordered from retailer. it looks like an all white skirt that has a little stiffness to it but looks are deceiving. it has this weird checkered patten and there is no shape to the skirt at all. there are also weird stitching lines. one more thing that i didn't like about the skirt was that it's a cream-ish color. not even the cute flamingos will make me keep this skirt. it's going back.,Negative
"I really love these jeans! they are so comfortable and are very flattering. i am 5'10 and a size 6. i bought the 28 regular and they fit perfectly. i have high hips, so i appreciate the mid rise in these. the length was perfect too, so i'm glad i did not purchase the tall. the length was the same on me as in the picture. the jeans arrived uncuffed, and they look just as cute without the cuff as they do with. i will definitely wear them with and without a cuff for different looks. i am very happy",Positive

"I bought the navy polka dot top and i love the way the design lets you work orange into your wardrobe if it's a color you wouldn't normally wear. the blouse is sheer so a camisole is needed underneath; i'm looking forward to layering over the blouse in the fall to add a pop of pattern to a navy sweater.
i'm a 34f and size 12 fit me easily with extra room under the arms. the gathering stops above the bust so that it fit's snug above and loose below. worn loose, the blouse is fairly long, coverin",Positive
"I was able to purchase this on sale and i'm so glad i did. i usually go between a size s and m (133 lbs., 5' 5"", 34 d) but the small fits perfectly. the color really isn't dark orange as stated......kind of a cross between rose/pale red/ salmon but i really love the color. it's not super heavy weight but not really thin either....actually perfect!",Positive
"I passed over this dress online thinking i'd never wear it. but, then i found myself inside an retailer store and decided to try it on. i am excited to say that i love this dress. it is soft and lovely. the cowl is large and the whole dress has a really great drape. my favorite thing is that the buttons along the back are functional. opening up the back turns this dress into a long cardigan that is to die for.",Positive
"I wanted to love this dress. the colors are heavenly and it looks light and airy. it isn't, it is very heavy, much too heavy for florida heat. the top layer is a beautiful sand color and while the fabric is nice, the heaviness of the top really weighs the whole dress down. i felt like it added ten pounds to my appearance, easily. back it went, boo hoo. if you are between sizes, i would size down, runs a bit big.",Neutral
"The cut of this dress is what drew me to order it, but it is so much more! first, the fabric is more of a raw silk, which is more like a soft linen than silk.. it's also got a very soft lining that feels great on the skin, and it has pockets! love a dress with pockets! i also love that the design is on the front and back. i am 5' 4"", 133 lbs and a 36c, and ordered a size 6. it's a little big on the sides, so i probably should've returned it for a 4, but it wasn't big enough to make it annoying o",Positive
"This dress did end up working out for me. however i am very narrow in my chest and shoulders and i can see how it would be too tight on anyone with a med-lrg chest and/or broad shoulders. the fabric is light weight, nice for summer. it will need to be ironed and will wrinkle easily but it still looks well made to me. the slip is smaller than the dress but i feel that the dress is supposed to be ""drapey"". i kept it.",Positive
"This jacket is the best! definitely my staple jacket for the spring. it is so comfortable and soft. i usually wear a small in retailer clothing, but i opted for the medium in this so there's a little room for layering. even with the extra room, it is so flattering. i absolutely love this jacket!",Positive
"I'm so glad i found this gem in the store, as the online pic does this shirt no justice!  the green version is vibrant and adorable, and this shirt is lightweight, without being see-through.  for sizing reference: i'm 5'4"", 135 lbs, 34c and a size 6 petite.  i tried this in the store in a size 4 and an 8 (only sizes they had) and rushed home to order it online in a 6.  perfect fit, so i believe its true to size.  the little details...the buttons and stitching make this shirt such a winner!",Positive
"So this is actually a holding horses dress, its mislabeled on the website. tts, a stunning vintage inspired piece, very 40's but timeless. the keyhole isn't too low cut, this is appropriate for work. beautiful drape and great lining - this dress can twirl! i am usually a xsmall/small and went with the small, fits perfectly though a bit loose in the waist but still very flattering - the xsmall would have been too tight in the shoulders. lovely dress!",Positive
This dress drapes very well and is flattering to many different body shapes. the colors give it the flexibility to wear from summer into fall. gorgeously designed!,Positive
"I bought the color ""black motif""although the markings look more dark purple and are similar to tie dyed coloring which is one of the things i love about this top. the fabric is so soft and i love the way the neckline falls. it is slightly sheer so may want to wear camisole underneath. personally i'm fine without it. looks great with jeans. i also tried it on in the ""blue motif"" which is the stripe version but found nothing special about that one.",Positive
"I really looked forward to receiving this piece, it was however extremely difficult to get on and off. you have to step into it and it is very narrow. it is difficult to get your arms in and i had to have my husband's help getting it off. i am 5'9"" 135 pounds. i have a fit figure. i ordered a medium, i wear a small or x-small for a top and an 8 in shorts or pants. once it was on i was not thrilled with the extra material around the hips and tummy area. it is not terribly becoming, it bunches up",Positive
"I love this slip.. i am contemplating whether i can pass it off as a dress over the summer. the skirt is a subtle shinier grey than the top. it is flattering with or without a bra and i am not usually the type to go without. i am 5'3, 32c and the xs fits perfectly! also i think it looks better in person.",Positive
"I love it! i was hesitant to spend so much on a suit, but it's well worth the money. i'm 5'3"", 140 lbs, and my stomach is my biggest problem area. i ordered a size 8 and it's a perfect fit and very flattering.",Positive

"I have purchased many different styles of pilcro jeans, and have loved them all!!! these, unfortunately i do not like. i think they run large and the fit, just blah. the waist gapped and kinda had a ""mom jean"" look. i felt the quality was also not up to standard for this brand.",Neutral
"This was such an impulse buy- i bought it online during a sweater sale- and i am so glad i did! this is definitely one of my favorite recent purchases. it definitely seems more like a coat than a sweater, but it is lightweight. i ordered the red and it is beautiful. it looks great buttoned or left open and i think this could be dressed up or down (though it does have a hood, so that gives it a slightly more casual feel). it fits true to size- and it is definitely shorter in the front than the ba",Positive
Fun top for day or evening.,Positive
"Love this one. i usually wear a medium, got this in medium and fits perfectly. i agree with the prior reviewer regarding the arms, they are a little snug, but i like the fit just as is. the pattern and medium thinkness were just what i was looking for.",Positive
"I bought this dress for an awards ceremony, and couldn't be more pleased. the quality and detailing on the dress are great, and the hidden side zipper makes the dress easy to put on. i love that it's machine washable on a delicate setting. i've already worn it twice, and can't wait to wear it again for easter.",Positive
"A perfect basic tee!
loved how soft it is. not worth full price, but definitely one to add to your cart once on sale.",Positive
"Tried this on today at my local retailer and had to have it. it is so comfortable and flattering. it's too bad the picture online has the model tucking it into the skirt because you can't see the ruching across the front. a little dressier alternative to a plain tee and reasonably priced for retailer. 5'8"""" and i generally wear a 6, the small fit well. will probably be back for the black!",Positive
"The craftmanship & material (not itchy at all to me) are exquisite for this unique sweater/coat, but the shape is not for me. i have a slender build, 5'8"" 130 lbs, 34 b chest (i oredered my usual sm, which fit), and the silouette of this piece looked ridiculous on me. when buttoned, the top half was nicely fitted-- not snug; however, the lower half ballooned out to overemphasize the hips due to the pleating in back. the thing is, i have no hips, and having hips is a very good thing, though not i",Positive
"I've been looking for a leather or faux leather jacket for years and years and this is the first one that i've ever loved so much! the style is edgy and modern, yet still feminine and flattering. love the cut of the jacket, so flattering! looks amazing with dresses, skirts or denim. i got the dark red color, and it's much more brown and neutral than it appears online. i would love to get the tan color as well, but it's currently sold out in my size. the faux leather looks believable and expensiv",Positive
This dress is very lightweight and great for fall/spring weddings. i received several compliments all night! sits very nice on the waist as well!,Positive
This is such a cute and different jacket. of course i asked if they had it in black but i am glad they didn't because this is such a great color that is so versatile. i use it as a topper when it is not that cold out with a short sleeve under it or a long sleeve fitted shirt. you can wear with jeans or black pants if you want. great material for the price as well. i am usually between a small but more of a medium in my jackets. i ordered this in xs/s and it has plenty of room to even wear a swea,Positive

"On the hanger, this looks like a great dress .. especially to wear to a hawaii wedding. on me, not quite.

"I got this dress in pxxs in the gray color, i am 5'4"", 100lbs, petite frame, and it fits like a dream. true to size. the fabric is super soft and thick, drapes well, not too tight, and u can wear a regular bra!!!. length is also perfect, no shortening required (which is rare for me - this could be an issue for tall girls but i wouldnt know about that). it looks great with dressy flip flops for any summer occasion, can be casual or dressy depending on accessories. great purchase, 100% recommend.",Positive
"This tank top is great under cardigans or worn over shorts. the pocket and the seam along the bottom give it enough detail to be worn as a stand alone, but not too much to overshadow a stylish sweater layered over it. i bought the white one in the store in a medium and it fit great. then i purchased two more online (mango and pink) in the same size and they run a bit smaller than the one in the store. i thought the mango was a soft yellow from the photo online but it's pretty bright, as is the p",Positive
"This is beautiful tunic for the spring and summer. great paired with jeans or white denim. runs large and is a true tunic length. very pretty fabric and built in camisole, too. only downside is that it probably needs to be hand washed/line dried to keep it looking like new.",Positive

"I did the happy dance when the dress arrived, but the very sad dance when i tried it on. unfortunately, instead of following my instincts, i took the review here (and reviews from some other sites) to heart and ordered a size bigger than usual . huge mistake, as in this dress was huge -- much too big to alter and keep the integrity of design. for reference i'm 5'7, 130lbs, 34c. i usually wear an 8 dress (due to a very large rib cage). i ordered the 10 but was literally swimming. i think a 6 woul",Positive
"I bought the pink, which is a vibrant but not neon shade of deep reddish pink. love it. i love how the flutter of the sleeves is balanced with a slimmer fitting body, which keeps it from looking frumpy. i did order a size down to achieve this look. i prefer a more tailored look so this suits me while satisfying my desire for a little whimsy now and then. my only issue is that it's too low cut. trying to decide if i just need to wear it with a lower-cut bra or if this requires a cami. i hate laye",Positive

"Despite the fact that this jacket is made from a gorgeous ottoman looking knit fabric, and has perfect fit, nice arm length, looks good on the hanger, the jacket did me no justice at all. it arrived folded, in the mail, so i had to press down the unruly pleats before i could try it on (you have to do this with nearly every item you buy online that comes folded flat and stuck in a cellophane bag.). so i pressed the jacket, tried to neaten the pleats but to no avail. the pleats would not stay put",Neutral
"I purchased this gaucho as a gift for my mother.
at first, i was about to try it for myself because gaucho is a little trend nowadays.
but later, it turned out that it was a perfect fit for my mother.
it went well with her perhaps because she saved a lot of her fashion from 1980s.
it also fit well with contemporary fashion as well.
however, i think it matches better with vintage fashion than to contemporary fashion.
so, if you happen to save those ""good old fashion"", take them out and try",Positive
Still can't decide if i want to keep this. it's super comfortable but much thinner than expected and the color seems more navy blue than black.,Neutral
"The fit on this is so strange. the middle string is definitely too long and the thin halter top offers hardly any lift. the print is lovely and the quality nice for the price. the cups are padded, which is nice i suppose, but would barely cover anything bigger than a c cup i'm guessing. i'm a 32dd, size 8 in pants, and size 4/6 in dresses and i ordered a medium. i also have a long torso, which probably didn't help.",Negative
"This is a very cute top. i am 5'4'', 170lbs, 34dd, and a large fit great. it fit perfectly in the chest, but the top is meant to be baggy at the bottom and long (it covers my bum). looks very cute with skinny jeans. love it!",Positive
A very versatile and cozy top. would look great dressed up or down for a casual comfy fall day. what a fun piece for my wardrobe!,Positive
"This sweater is beautiful! it fits/drapes nicely, is a gorgeous color, feels soft, and is comfortable to wear. i'm generally a s or m in this brand and opted for the medium. the sleeves are pretty long--i have to role them up a bit or they cover half my hand, but that's all right--they look fine rolled. i highly recommend!",Positive
I love tiny button down tops. this one didn't work at all for me. i was excited about the mix prints but on it looked like i was wearing a vest over a striped shirt. also the arm was frayed on the shirt i tried on.,Negative
"Reference: 100#, 5'1, 32a... ordered size xs.  the suit is pretty.  under the neckline, where the two orange panels meet the white center panel, that corner puckers a bit.  this will not happen if you have a larger chest than my 32a or have a longer/broader torso so that the fabric can stretch out, thus pulling that merging area flat.  the sides (cut out) lays flat when you stand up straight and gapes when your turn/bend to the side.  i think this is expected.  the bottom section, on the back, c",Positive

This is one of those stunning retailer pieces that keep us coming back for more. it reminds me of the lithe dresses from the earlier retailer days. it fits tts. well made with side zipper that zips both the inner sheath and outer tulle overlay ( as opposed to those obnoxious linings that you wrestle with). the inner sheath has a fabulous lattice work pattern while the overlay has beading and embroidered detail.  sure to sell out.,Positive
"This cardigan is very cute and versatile. the knit is medium weight and will work well for moderate weather. i would say that the sizing is pretty true to size, but maybe runs just a bit large. thus, if you are in between sizes, order the smaller size.",Positive
"I like the idea of the dress, just not the fit in the bust. i'm not particularly big (32c), but it just didn't fit up there. i wish the dress had built in support because you can't really wear a bra.",Neutral
I am very happy with this shirt. i don't like skin tight clothes. i bought this top a bit loose but it does not look like i am wearing a sack. it is tunic length on me so i have worn it with jeans and boots. i love the way it flows while i walk. very flattering on. would definitely recommend!,Positive
"I've been looking for a great white blouse for awhile, and this is it! the tie waist is especially flattering for hourglass figures, but i'm sure it would add some curves to any body type. the fabric is soft, not crisp, and drapes beautifully. you definitely will be doing some ironing, though. it's a bit sheer, but i always wear nude bras and felt no need for a cami. i did buy the regular, rather than petite sizing and usually wear a 0 or 2, but had to size up to a 4 regular to avoid gaping in f",Positive
"The fabric was nothing special (i usually like a cotton/silk blend woven fabric, but this was stiff feeling) and the pattern was cute. but what made me return it was the fact that 1) the rose gold glitter dots are puffy paint. literally. puffy. paint. and 2) the dots were not quite dry on my top when it arrived. parts of the paint came off on my fingers and the top was stuck to itself because of it. i could barely unfold it.

I was excited about this - - such a lovely look online. but on me...it was just meh. i'm a little heavy right now so that could be playing into it...but i will say i loved the top part of the dress. very flattering and subtly sexy. but the bottom..it just hangs like a rag. it needs either more material for a swishier effect...or it needs to be a different material. or maybe knit just doesn't work on me in the form of a dress! the knit is nice but i kind of also feel like it is chintzy...i can't,Neutral

"I can't say enough about this top! absolutely adorable, the pics don't do it justice. it is made of a soft, medium weight jersey material. the lace makes the top more dressey and unique. the drop waiste elongatesy our torso and is loose pleated at the bottom for interest. i am 5'6'', 135 pounds, and long waisted. this fits me perfect (sz small.) the pleated bottom on me begins at low hips (below belly button) so it layes nice and is very flattering. no swing to the top,no bulky extra flare at al",Positive
I had to call so many stores to track this shirt down and in the end it wasn't worth it. i got an xs and it was quite baggy. i never buy petite shirts because i feel like they are too short but in this case i think the shirt would have been perfect in whatever the smallest petite size is. for someone who's bigger i'd definitely check this shirt out.,Neutral
"Wow was this top huge on me! i am usually a large, but lean towards xl when things don't have stretch. i sized up out of fear that my bust couldn't squeeze into a large (36dd) and i didn't want the buttons in the back to gape. when i took this out of the package (i purchased the blue) i knew right away it was way too big. looked like it could fit my husband. the sides poofed out so far, i looked ridiculous (if you look at the photos, the model is trying very hard to control the poofiness with he",Neutral

"This is such a neat dress. the color is great and the fabric is super soft. i am tall so the long length was an added bonus. it definitely needs something underneath since the front gaps. i am going to pair it with a funky tank top, necklaces and boots. super cute!!",Positive
Love this dress! it can be worn in cold or warm weather with tights and boots or sandals and bare legs. the fit is roomy and a little longer in back. it washes nicely without losing length.,Positive
"I ordered a regular size s and it was way too boxy for my body type and shorter than the stated length. i don't know if the length stated is from a size m, but the small was definitely shorter (in the front at least).  if you're petite with curves like me, it's not a flattering cut.",Negative
"Loved the material and the style. unfortunately, my fears came true when i received this swimsuit, and there wasn't enough support despite a review i had read. as a 36d, i thought the halter would be enough support, however, the material is too stretchy to rely on that completely. i am sad i won't be keeping this though. the material is heavenly!!!",Negative
"This dress is even prettier in person. i'm 5'5"" and usually a 4 in fit and flare dresses and got this in a 4. fits like a glove and hits right above my knee. the hook and eye closure does get caught on the delicate lace, so be careful of that. otherwise, this dress is perfect for summer weddings!",Positive

"This is a great white dress for summer.

i tried on a 4 in store and it was too big for me especially in the underarm area. when i tried on the 2, it fit perfectly. i almost felt like there should be a 3, ha ha, because it felt like it made more of a difference to downsize than i expected. that being said, i took the 2 home since it looked like it was tailored to fit my body (but not in a super tight way).

fyi, i'm not super curvy. if you have a larger chest you may need your regular size.",Positive
"So, this dress is extremely comfortable, but it's just really awkward. i am on the fence about keeping it, my husband loves it and thinks i should. it just draws attention to the belly, so any issues after having kids, is very noticeable. not to mention the huge cutouts for the arms. very comfortable, but not sure if i will keep it.",Neutral
I love the style of this dress but felt that it didn't look great on. really sad it didn't work out :( felt like it was too short and the drop waist was awkward and looked childish. beautiful fabric and design if it fits you well though!,Positive
"I needed to write a review only because i feel like the dress is getting a bad rap by other reviewers. it is a loose, flowy, swing dress. i typically wear structured fit and flare dresses, but i do love a feminine, loose, casual dress from time to time too. this totally fit the bill. it is true to size, fitted on the arms, loose and swingy everywhere else. i got the peach color and love it. the cotton slip underneath is very comfortable too. i ordered the sp and it hits just above my knees in th",Positive

"Someone else mentioned that this fit like a grandpa sweater and they were absolutely right. it's definitely loose fitting, but it's really cute and well made. i usually get a medium size in tops/sweaters but, after reading the other reviews, i ordered the small and i'm so glad i did - it's the perfect casual cardigan. i wish it came in more colors!",Positive
I think this jumpsuit is different! the xs fit well and the material is a pretty color but very soft. the store had it styled with a metallic scarf that really accessorized it well.  i thought it would be great for my date night but stopped short of buying because i just can't picture this worn to other outings.  it is very unique though so i just might be back to purchase.,Positive
"Great dress! needs a tank top underneath, but has a great shop.",Positive
"I purchased this in the cream/beige color and love that it will go with everything. i can add details with long necklace or scarf-even a belt but it also stands alone and looks great with leggings or skinny jeans. i would also wear with a neutral skirt as shown on model. the fabric is not too thin and with a bit of cashmere will also add some warmth. it may shed some depending if you wear a nylon cami underneath. i purchased the xs, my usual size and fits great. 5'8-slender. love my purchase!",Positive
Absolutely love everything about this dress. unlike many other dresses i've ordered from retailer it fits me in the chest (34c). it's very flattering. love the lace up front and the fabric is like a soft lined linen. can't wait to wear it. i got the s regular. if i was any bigger in the chest or through the ribs tho it would be too small. i almost ordered the medium and was certain i would end up needing a bigger size but the small turned out just right. like it was made for me,Positive
"The lace on this top is pretty, and i liked the way it was styled in the product photos, but did nothing for me on. between the loose sleeves and the boxy cut of the front, it just sort of hung shapelessly on me. i also found the back to be much shorter than 30.5""--it came to a few inches below my hips and was not tunic length like i expected. the shoulders fit me well, and because the top was boxy already, i didn't want to size up for length. for reference i tried on xs (i'm 5'4"", 120 lbs).",Neutral

I usually wear an xxsp in retailer brands. i bought this jacket in a regular size 0 and it fits like a glove. even the sleeves are the right length. it really accents my narrow waist. i imagine it runs very small for those who wear regular sizes. if you are petite this is the jacket for you. the jacket is unlined so i cant wear it in cold weather. it is very nice over a dress with black boots and with skinny jeans. i receive complements every time i wear this item!,Positive

"This sweater is really pretty (and soft!) in real life, but if you purchase the coral color, be ready for a little bit of a surprise when you open the package. while it looks more orange and subdued online, it's more like a hot pink coral in real life. definitely more pink than orange and far more vibrant than pictured. still pretty, but not necessarily my taste so still deciding if it will go back or not. the cut and fit of the sweater is wonderful, though. it's so soft and airy, but definitely",Positive

"Love this dress!! i ordered the blue for some color and it is nicer in person than in the photo. the fabric and color are beautiful. can dress this up or wear for work. i am 5', 110 lbs and 35/26/35 and got the size xs petite. it is a loose fit but not too loose. very unique dress that i can wear all fall and winter.",Positive
"Picture definitely does not do this vest justice.  i saw it on a rack and had to try on and instantly loved the look and feel.  i am 5'9"" - 135 lbs - size 6 and the small works for me.  the vest will work with ivory, black, grey, and red underneath.  i love the little bits of fur sticking out of the seams.  the back has fitted seams to give it a trim look.  there are small pockets in the front as well.  definitely worth the 108$ asking price.",Positive
Simple pull-on pant with a great design. they look flattering on and can easily be dressed up. i wear between a 4 and 6 and the small fit perfect. i have washed them and worn them several times and they still seem good as new. the wide elastic waistband ensures that they stay in place.,Positive
Love the fabric of this shirt even though it was thinner than i expected. it is soft to the skin and flattering. however i returned it because it is made for women with long torso and shorter shoulders.,Negative

"Love this top, wore it for the first time today and it looks so good. soooo flattering from the front. the back is plain, but ive got some back fat, so i wear a jacket.",Positive
Love these pajama bottoms. they are so comfortable and the print is fun and unique. i highly recommend. they run true to size and have a great length. they look short on the model but mine are perfect.,Positive
"Pros: this skirt is a stunner. beautiful, rich color and great quality. the cut is conservative enough to be work appropriate, but the little peek of above-the-knee leg where the slit is makes it interesting and flattering as well.

cons: slightly smelly when it comes out of the bag- i'm optimistic this will mostly go away though. expensive.

fit: i'm 5'8"", 125 lbs, 34b, normally wear a 26 or 27 in pants, and the size 2 fit great. i often wear a size 4 in skirts despite a size 2 fitting fine in",Positive
I love the black and grey version of the vest but decided too try it in plum. the plum color is used only on the lapels and inside of the garment. it has no finished seams but it is like a soft boiled wool so it wouldn't ravel. the seam in the waistline area breaks up the design and adds more interest.,Positive
"This cute top is made in the usa- yay! it is a flattering cut and looks great under jackets. i prefer the ivory color and feel of the fabric. the black and white was cute, but hung strangely and felt stiff. i am size sm/med, 34c and went with the small. cowl is cozy and can be styled to keep you warm.",Positive
"This sweater is extremely roomy. the cut is very wide - wider than it is long, the sleeves are dolman style, and the neck is a little loose. with a lot of manipulation i managed to convince myself that i wasn't wearing a tent, but i would suggest sizing down and also being tall and thin, if you can. i'm keeping mine despite a funky fit on my hourglass frame because i'm exploring funky town lately. join me at your own risk!",Neutral
"I saw this dress online, and i thought it was perfectly cute! however, once i tried it on at home, it just didn't work. one of the buttons broke in half as i tried unbuttoning, and once i got it on, the dress was so small that the cuffs cut off circulation to my forearm.

"This shirt is so cute! i was unsure about how flowy the sleeves would be- as i'm not one for frills- but the sleeves sit nicely. also, i am between a size small and medium, i got the small and it definitely is flowy. runs big, so if you like a tighter fit you may want to order a size down. i got the red and it's a perfect autumn / winter color. the cut outs are not too showy- so it's not revealing for us gals who are a little more belly-conscious. it's the perfect shirt to just throw on and go a",Positive

Loved this romper! wish it was offered in petite... arm sleeves are too long once it's off shoulders.,Positive
"It's amazing!

i did size down on this one, but i didn't have to. that depends on the kind of fit you are looking for. sizing down did make the shirt more form fitting in my chest area, but also did make the garment somewhat less comfortable in the armpit area for being tighter (but not too tight). my normal size would have alleviated this problem, but also would have left the shirt with not a whole lot of shape. i opted to have a little shape and deal with the fabric slightly digging into my",Positive
"For my body type, this top looked ridiculous! i am small-busted and thinnish on top. this seemingly very pretty top look like a big rectangle on me. very unflattering. hard to tell if it was true-to-size because it hung so wide. i think for a gal with more substantial upper body (i.e., boobs) this would work better.",Neutral

"Just tried 'layered sadie top' and it felt so nice on. good hand feel for both materials but note that the knit on top is a little too delicate for machine wash but can be hand washed. this item is definitely ""vanity-sized"". i'm 5'1, 113lbs and the xs looked nothing like how it does on the model. it was flowy as depicted but it came down much lower on me and looked a little maternity-esque. highly recommend because it's gorgeous and well made but i would definitely come in and try it out for you",Positive
"Just what i was looking for. soft, cozy and warm.",Positive
I buy everything that retailer sells in chambray. this top did not disappoint. it is so comfortable and the back the way it is slightly lower than normal is very sexy without being revealing. the straps fall off of your shoulders a bit but i do not find it annoying. i am not big busted so i didn't have the sizing issue that others seemed to have.,Positive
"It's a pretty dress, my only concern is the sleeve length. it's an awkward length and makes the dress look a little frumpy. i turned the sleeve up once and it looks so much better!. or, if you are a savvy sewer, you may want to tighten a little in the arms so the sleeve is a bit more fitted. overall quality and feel is very good. i usually fit into a 6, but for this dress i ordered both 6 and 8 and kept the 8. the chest is a bit snug and the button pops open if you don't order the correct size.",Positive
"This is a great dress - nice soft fabric and the red is a nice, vibrant tomato red color.  i ordered a small - i am 5'4"" and usually wear a 4 in dressed.  this dress was so huge - it might be mismarked but labeled a small.  i will have to return it - not even my seamstress can make it fit!",Neutral
"I was surprised how much i like this shirt. the fit is really pleasing. at first i thought it would be a ""whatever"" shirt, but i think i will actually wear it a lot more. it will look cute dressed up with a cute necklace and flats. the price is a bit high for this top, but i felt it was worth it since it is so hard finding a casual shirt thats not your basic tee.",Positive
"This dress is so much more stunning in person than in the photos. it's incredibly flattering, and i like how it pans out at the bottom. it also has pockets! although it has a built-in slip, it is a little see-through, so keep that in mind, otherwise, i can't wear it enough.",Positive
"This is one of those rare garments that is actually as flattering on me as it looks on the model. just like the picture, it hangs like a dress and emphasizes my curves without seeming too revealing. the weight of the fabric creates graceful movement, while the loose cut keeps it cool and breezy. for reference, i am 5'4"" and curvy (34d, 35x28x39), and i ordered a small petite. this is a smaller size than i would wear in most styles, but it fits almost like it was made for me. the tie hits slightl",Positive

Just got this yesterday and i'm wearing it today! super comfy for running errands with the kids and going to and from the gym...or just to lounge around the house. i go between a m and l and went with a m since its flowy and it fits great.,Positive
This was an impulse purchase for me. a year ago i would have never considered a jumpsuit but they are growing on me. i had yet to find one that fit without too much need for tailoring. this one did the trick! i like that the cut is in such a way that you can wear a normal bra underneath it without it showing. the fabric itself is very lightweight so i would recommend a bra for some support. i like that the fabric is incredibly lightweight so you can wear it on a hot summer day. the jumpsuit is l,Positive
"Love this dress! really nice quality, timeless design, not to mention the flared sleeves are so flattering! this dress makes me feel so cute and tiny. i normally struggle to function in off the shoulder tops but deal with it because i love the way that they look, but this one really is the perfect fit and has just the right amount of give without being too loose. the body size and length does run large, so size down on this one. now i understand why the petites were all sold out? whatever, modes",Positive

"Another shirt i really wanted to love. i adore green but so few tops are made in this color. (please make more!!) however, this shirt didn't work for me. i think it's a matter of where your curves live. the shirt was true to size, but my boobs meant i was showing more cleavage than the model, and the top part felt more like a bib than embroidery. sad coz it is lovely and feels lovely on. probably a great shirt for different body types. would love to see more green clothing....",Neutral

I had to have this when i saw it in a store. i was drawn to the shape and the neutral colors. i wore it for the first time today with a black tank. on me it looks best unbuttoned. it looks good with pants. the small fit best although the arms are a little tight at the upper arms. i have muscles so i don't think i could wear it with any top with sleeves.,Positive

This dress is awesome - i actually first saw it on lucy lui on elementary and thought it had to be from retailer. sure enough it was and it was on sale. i got the blue and would have gotten both if they had my size. i am usually a m and found this fit true to size. i always love a wrap dress and this with the buttons keeps it from spilling open - love it!,Positive

Love this coat. the colour is vibrant and it is well made. it does however run small. for me it was two sizes. i am usually a 00p and ended up purchasing the 2p. glad i tried it on in a store. it is a good spring/fall coat as it is lightweight. if i had purchased the 4p i could layer it a bit more. good but though. just be sure to size up.,Positive

"I love the feel and drape of silk. this dress has lovely drape, and fantastic color. i think if paired with the right sweater and leggings, this will work well into the fall, and also transition into other seasons if you are savvy! the only awkward point about this dress is that you must wear a belt with it if you have an hourglass shape, otherwise it's a beautiful swing fit.",Positive
"This dress is beautiful! runs a little bit large. i usually wear a small or medium. i took the petite small in this dress. i am 5'3"" and ordered in petite sizing and i am so glad that i did. the only complaint that i have is that there is no liner and although the dress has some dark colors, it is very sheer, very see through.",Positive
"I loved this dress as soon as i tried it on, but... it bunched up weird in the front around my hips. i ordered a second size 4, hoping that it would fit better. but same thing. if i tried to go to a size 6 it would be too big every where else. fyi - i'm 5'8"" 129lbs and i'm a runner. it's not like i have a huge backside or anything. my guess is sizing is off. i've tried another of his dresses and it fit perfectly.",Positive
The jumpsuit is very pretty but it's definitely not meant for women who are on the curvier side or shorter. plus it sort of looks like pajamas on. i am 5'7 and i wanted to to look similar to the model in the picture but it comes down to my ankles so it would look best on taller/thin woman.,Neutral
"The navy blue lines on my dress on the very top of the interior layer can be seen through the upper layer at the very top and it looks cheap. for this price, i would expect more thoughtful patterning. the fit is amazing, so i am debating whether i should keep or return.",Neutral
I purchased this for my 20-something daughter. it is so complimentary and cute and stylish!,Positive
"I hoped to love this based on the prior review, but i didn't. it's a beautifully crafted top but the print didn't look good on me. and although i grabbed during the sale it's too expensive to keep when it's not perfect.",Positive
"This dress is beautiful. swingy and fun, and the floral pattern is just stunning for fall and winter. i am planning on wearing it with black tights and ankle booties. could be dressed up or down- very versitle. fits my tall curvy frame perfectly. love.",Positive
"Great everyday dress. i bought a small (5'9, 135lbs) and it really fits nicely.",Positive
This is so adorable and flattering. dress it up or down with a denim jacket weekday to weekend.w/flats or pumps. love this cute dress. not all wool so it's not itchy at all. the colors are vibrant and would compliment any complexion!,Positive
When i returned this the salesperson asked what was wrong w it bc it keeps being returned. i got the black w the white collar/cuffs. i thought it was terribly itchy material (which could be remedied w a shirt underneath) but the white collar part was such a dull ugly white-dirty color. maybe the other colors are better?,Negative
"The skirt in person is not like the picture. baggy and runs large. i wear jean size 25 and the xs is two size too loose. there's no pocket which is surprising on a denim. the slit in front makes the skirt  look even loose , no shape near what's in the picture. and there's no petite sizes. i am going to return it.",Neutral

"I'm in love with these tanks. so in love that i bought four of them (black, grey, blue, and the black motif). they are so flattering on. i love the low scoop neck and the wide straps. the cut is interesting enough to wear the shirt on its own, but also perfect for under a cardigan. i purchased a nearly identical one from retailer (which was made by velvet) several months ago and it was much more pricey. these are a much more affordable option.",Positive
"I was nervous about this dress, as when i ordered it there were no reviews yet...and shortly after they, they started coming in and were only negative. yes it runs pretty big (i'm usually a large/12 but could tell from the model it would run big) but it's supposed to be loose. i wouldn't say it's the most flattering - but you can tell it's shapeless from the picture! it's a great casual dress, perfect for hot days when i don't want my clothing touching my skin.",Positive
"Love this top. purchased in a size medium, my typical retailer size and is very comfortable and lovely. wearing it under the pink peplum cardigan it was shown together with as well as wear it with jeans and other pants. i wish it came in different colors and other images as this a very well made top. purchased during the after christmas tag sale and love it even more. will be great in spring and summer, cooler days in summer.",Positive
"This is the softest shirt, super comfy, very baggy but i'd say true to size for the style. it is a bit thin and i'm worried how it will hold up, or would have given the full 5 stars. i'm not a usual fan of the turtle neck but this is so soft, i love it!",Positive
"I ordered the red in xs petite, xxs and xxs petite (in case petite was too short). so far, the xs petite and xxs petite were shipped to me, however, thought the bag said petite, the actual dresses inside were regular sizes, and they were huge, even the xxs (i put it on on top of another knit dress and it was big0. so i reordered, this time only the xxs petite (though i am technically waiting for the xxs regular)... perhaps all the bags have been switched... we shall see, but perhaps this isn't t",Positive
"While the print is cute, the fit is a disaster if you are a c cup or fuller. the bottom band does not lay flat as pictured on the model (it rides up under your boobs) and the whole cup area tips forward - it's not really molded like a bra, more flat foam insert. immediately went back. hopefully, if retailer continues to do swimwear, they'll take a look at adjusting the designs to make sure they're also workable for fuller cup sizes (underwire please!)",Negative
"I ordered this dress, along with several others, for an upcoming wedding. this was my favorite of all of them as far as style; unfortunately it just didn't fit. i'm 5'2"" 116lbs and my regular size 2 was slightly too long, the waist a bit too low, the shoulders a tad too wide. as a result it hung on me like on a hanger. i guess i would need a petite but alas does not appear to come petite...",Positive
Very comfy and really nice fabric. can see myself wearing these a lot. i'm a size 12 and the fit was perfect.,Positive
"I was looking forward to receiving this dress. i am tired of all of the swing dresses - most of which are not flattering on my petite frame. i am also uncomfortable with dresses that fall much above the knee as i am somewhat older. the colors and fabric of this dress are beautiful. vibrant, but not too bright. when i got it on i was thrilled with the fit - until i looked at the back. there are pleats at the waist in back and there is way too much fabric. it looked like i had a bustle under the d",Neutral
Super cute dress for fall. detail is much more intricate than what you are able to see online. not too long and will look perfect with tights and boots.,Positive
A great long line bra! beautiful and well made however it's tough to get the fit perfectly right. i usually wear a 32 b or 34 a and am 115lbs. the small was the best fit as the 32 (xs) was a very small 32. i could almost say it more of a 30 if that's even a size. it also rubs my skin few places so definitely not meant to be worn for more than a few hours. otherwise i recommend it!,Positive
"I was expecting to love this based on the reviews and my prior experience with this brand, but i'm a little unsure. the front part hangs a bit too low on my 5'4"" frame, yet i think a petite would have the slits too high on the sides. i'm just not sure it hangs right on me. it's fitted through the arms and shoulders nicely, and looks great with the front loosely tucked. just not what i was expecting.",Positive
"I don't know why i didn't pay much attention to this tee (the yellow), but i didn't. i saw it in the store, thought it was interesting and kept on going. then i really looked at it online and suddenly i had a bad case of the wants. so when i was in one of my local stores i asked about it, and no surprise, it was sold out. at the suggestion of my sales associate i tried on a solid one just for the size. although i'm small, i have several tla tees in medium, so i tried on a medium and a small. as",Positive
"I don't usually go for swing style dresses as i am petite, but this one was totally cute. i like the color a lot, wasn't sure it would work as i am rather pale, but it is nice. the xs p was returned at my store, why i tried it on... winner. 115 lbs, 26.5 in waist, 30dd chest. i can see myself wearing this in summer, spring or fall (with boots).",Positive
This top is such a great investment piece. looks classy and is comfortable all at the same time. it is pricey but you will not regret buying this. goes great with light trouser denim or i have the green pilcro khakis. it will he something you will keep in your closet for a long time.,Positive
The embroidery on this dress is beautiful in person. perfect dress for fall.,Positive
"This skirt is figure flattering and stylish, while still being work appropriate. i like the length as well.",Positive
"I ordered my typical 6 petite and found that the buttons were pulling at the bust ( i'm 34 b) and at the waist. i'm returning and ordering a size 8 petite because i'm a sucker for a shirtdress and a cute novelty print. the quality is nice and the length was perfect for my short 4""11 frame, now only to wait for it to be shipped! oh how i wish petites were available in my local store!",Positive
"Cute shirt with a few nice details: embroidery and tasseled tie in back. a little pricey in my view for what you get. nice, loose cut. true to size. cotton is very sheer. i'm well-stocked on white see-through shirts that require a cami, looking for one that doesn't need layering- returned for this reason.",Positive
Beautiful skirt but runs small. not for eveyone- this is for those with flat stomachs. i had to size up from a 6 to an 8 for my stomach to not stick out in this skirt and then it looked to wide on the bottom and lost the slick pencil look. if you are fit and firm this is a gorgeous skirt. it is lined and fabric somewhat heavy.,Positive
"This is instantly one of my favorite dresses but please note it runs large, size down! i am 5'10"" and regularly a size 8-10. i tried both of those sizes on in store and picked the 8. it was perfectly form fitted and the perfect length. when i got home i realized i had been reading the uk sizes on the tag and really bought a size 4. no idea how it fit me, i have never purchased a size 4 in my life! i am adding a photo so potential customers can see what it looks like on an average sized person :)",Positive
"Love this dress! it is tighter in the chest area than maybe expected, but not unwearable, though i am smaller chested. it will be great for hot summer days as it has a light lining.",Positive
"I typically wear either a 2 or 4 and had to size up with this coat. the 6 fit, but i decided to go with an 8 to ensure it'd fit with layers. the sleeves aren't lined, so it's a little itchy against bare arms. it's really flattering and i love the pattern!",Positive
"I recommen only becuase i like it on other people, but not on me. the pull on style didn't work, i need xs petite to fit lenght and waist, but the waist wasn't elastic enough to ""pull up"" (i have let's say a booty#. i kept hearing hte stiching give... it also looked a little too poooofffy on my frmae, i am 5'1.5"" and it stuck more out than on the model. nice idea, btu not for me. #i am 115 lbs#",Neutral

xs fit me at 115 lbs.",Positive
"I picked this tunic up on sale; it works wonderfully with several of my cardigans and vests; just add skinny jeans or leggings and some boots for a fun, super comfortable look. the sleeves are oddly extra long, but not a deal breaker as rolling them up gives that unfinished cool look. i hate ironing, but i will iron this top as its so much fun to wear. the embroidered and beaded detail is quite nice.",Positive
"I absolutely love the fit and look of these jeans. i am 5'4"" and they fit perfectly. but oh my....the smell! it's like burnt chemicals. i don't know if it's just this pair, or a problem with this dye in general. any one find any solution to this? doesnt seem to go away with washing. may have to return these jeans if i can't get rid of the smell. :(",Positive

"It's pretty, floaty, feminine; the photos don't do justice to the prettiness. but the photos also don't show an asymmetrical hem. i understood it runs small so i got two sizes, to be safe, and even my larger size was strangely short-waisted, and i'm short-waisted to start with. maybe i could've lived with that, but both the dresses i received have an uneven hem unlike any i've ever worn or seen before. it's not longer on just the sides; the hem is longer in one spot on the front, and one in the",Negative

"I definitely would recommend this top. when i put it on i felt it was true to size, and fit me very well. sometimes my retailer tops tend to be a little roomy, but not in this case. the fit was very nice and its embroidery details make it a special look that i can throw on with my jeans and still look put together. i know this will be a top i wear often.",Positive

I ordered the sweater in a medium but it was too large - so reordered it in the small and it fits perfectly. love the length- it hits mid hip. it is more of an a-line than straight as show in the picture. the detail is fun and the sweater is well made. highly recommend it- i have received lots of compliments on this sweater.,Positive

"I tried this on in white and my usual size small. it is such a beautiful top and the detailing, lace trim is so pretty. my only complaint is that it lays funny on my cleavage, and i don't have much. it just gathered there and appeared clingy in that area. it's also one of those...am i hiding a pregnancy tops. i like it, but i think i'll wait to see if it goes on sale.",Positive

"I am a small, athletic build and typically wear an xsmall in tops. naturally, in something with a more straight fit and blousy shape, an xsmall would be appropriate. i ordered it and was super bummed. the lace detail made the collar lay funny and the shoulders were too tight. i liked the sheer fabric though and the lace details and decided to order a size up. i am so glad i did because everything laid like it was supposed to. this top is beautiful with a sexy, but refined look. i plan to dress i",Positive

Perfect slimming fit. wore it to work and then on to a holiday party. received multiple compliments throughout the day and evening!,Positive
"I was walking by my local retailer and saw this in the window and loved the colors. it's a great combination and looks good with white jeans, and regular denim. i like the cuffs on the sleeves and the textured material. it is a kimono - so in essence it is not form fitting. it's meant to flow over whatever else you have on. i purchased the xs/s and i am a normal size 2 and it looks cute. i got lots of compliments when i wore it! there are slits on either side at the bottom hem as well which allow",Positive
"This blazer is really well made, it has a nice weight and stretch to it. i think it might run a bit on the large size, i am sometimes a small and sometimes an xs and the xs is perfect. it's a great blazer to throw on to cinch together a casual yet put together look. i don't think the picture here does it justice. it will be getting a ton of wear in my work wardrobe. i love it!",Positive
"I was hoping this dress was a bit thicker, but when i tried it on the fabric was very thin and sheer. because of the body skimming design, this dress likely won't work on many without some serious spanx or body trimming hosiery. if you work out and are very fit, you might like it, but i don't so i'm not that brave! lol",Positive

I had no issues with size or length. i'm 5'9 34c bust and i bought the striped shirt in a 4 and the umbrella print in a 2. the 2 was ever so slightly tight at the second button but i was wearing a heavy cotton cami. i could have worn a 2 in the striped top as well. i am broad shouldered and the shoulder seam in the size 4 dropped a little so there was plenty of room. these shirts are adorable. i usually don't like button downs but this style is very flattering. the material is light and drapes w,Positive
Love the top! this is an attractive black top with a unique back which will match pretty much any thing in ones closet! yes i would say it runs a size bigger however it does not take away from the quality nor design,Positive

"I too was immediately drawn to this dress online and was this close to ordering a petite when i stopped my my local retailer and they had just gotten it in, in regular only. of course i tried it on (in the xs regular) and was thrilled to find it fit perfectly and was so flattering on my hourglass figure. i'm 5'1"" and 115 with a 32 dd chest. no gaping or pulling, the waist and shoulders were where they should be and i found the length, with the hi/lo hem to be just above my knees in front. i think",Positive
"I loved this dress especially because each flower appliquã© was so beautiful. however, each attached to one another by single threads. given that i wear lots of rings, i could already tell that i might snag these beautiful flowers. additionally, the appliquã©s are sewn so close to the back zipper that some of the flowers were already getting damaged from the dress being tried on. overall, if you are very careful, this is an amazing dress, but i did return it because of its delicate nature.",Neutral
"I absolutely adore this cardigan. it's very feminine, stylish, and comfortable and the gold color is gorgeous. i received numerous compliments when i wore it to work the first time. it's the perfect weight for transitional weather or chilly offices.",Positive
This dress is absolutely darling! it is light as a feather and floats on the body. the fabric looks almost handpainted and fits like a dream. i disagree with the previous poster and i think it looks very rich. super comfortable and i know i'll get lots of wear out of it. you can dress it up or dress it down. love it!,Positive
"I had high hopes after reading all of the reviews, but as you can see, the dress didn't live up to them. i ordered a size 8, and maybe a 6 would've fit better, but i'm not going to find out. the sheer area on the model really stands out; it does not in real life. there were loose threads throughout, and there really shouldn't be at this price point. i was going to wear this to a wedding, but as a member of the wedding party, i don't think it would picture well at all. i'm sorry that it's headed",Neutral
"I wanted to love this skirt. i love high-waisted skirts and the length seemed flattering on the model; it was not so flattering on me. the fabric is so lovely--truly the photos online don't do it justice. it's heavy and luxurious, wonderful for fall or winter, and the gold, gray, and navy floral pattern is not too flashy or bold. plus, pockets! however, the midi length did not work for me, despite the product's suggestion that it was a universally flattering length, just above the knee. i'm not",Neutral

"Not a summer dress even though the photos make it seem like it's for hot weather. the weight and layers and synthetic fabric is very substantial. it is a bit scratchy where there is maroon fabric, but not intolerable. i love this dress but it's beyond a-line, it's a tent. i'm keeping and will wear for fall with a long sweater to flatten the fullness that's seen in profile. for my body type (top heavy, thick shoulders/back/upper arms), i chose the smaller of my size range. definitely size down if",Positive
"The fabric on this top is just so soft. it's a thin cotton knit, and drapes beautifully.

the top runs tts, but.....it is tailored to the body. it's not loose and wide in the width. the length hits the top of the hips just as shown.

this works for casual or dress. for dress, i just put a fancy rhinestone pin over where the knot is. btw, i bought this in black, which is why adding the pin glams it up. although i bought it in black, it's not sheer so a cami isn't needed.",Positive
Lovely dress in bright teal color. the zipper was a bit sticky as the other reviewers had mentioned. unfortunately i sized up (6) based on past reviews and had to exchange for a smaller size(4). the fabric does have a bit of stretch so i'm really not sure why so many people had sizing issues. this is really a great buy with the current sale. tempted to pick up the red version too.,Positive
"Great blouse for curvy women. i'm always an xl in retailer tops, and even then sometimes the xls can be too tight to keep. however, i was so happily surprised with this blouse. the arms are usually an issue for me, but the arms in the blouse are perfect and loose in the bicep area. this blouse fits beautifully and is really high quality. the blouse lays nicely everywhere. i plan to wear it with a pair of gray pants so the lace cut out at the bottom shows up more. the lace is heavy duty and doesn't",Positive

"First of all, this skirt is as cute on as it is in the picture. very flattering. i am a curvy gal on the bottom and this is flattering. that being said, it runs small. i purchased a large which is my usual size, and i need another inch or two all over to make it work. part of the problem is the material. it is a very heavy, durable upholstery like material. there is absolutely no give to this. it is a very stiff material as well -- more what i would expect on a sofa than on my skirt. the skirt c",Negative

"This is a beautiful top! it fits like a glove, very flattering.& got lots of compliments.
i am 5'4"" and 125 lbs, i bought size medium. love it! worth the money:)",Positive
"This dress is black and white as pictured (as opposed to actually being cream), and it fits true to size. i've found that this particular brand runs tight in the shoulders for me, but that isn't the case here. the cut is very flattering, and it's great that this has functional pockets.

i was excited that the skirt is fully lined, but the top is ridiculously sheer. even with a nude bra, this dress needs a camisole underneath it. it's so flattering, but i'm not sure if i'll keep it.",Positive
"This top runs a little large. i should probably return for a smaller size but figure after i wash it, it'll shrink a bit. it's very flattering on and i really like the asymmetrical design. the only thing i don't like about it is that the fabric is a little itching without wearing a tank top underneath.",Positive
"This is a great throw in your weekend bag summer dress. it runs a bit large, especially on the top, but i'll make it work. back is a bit low, so a cardigan would be required for office wear.",Positive
Purchased the xs blue. love the fit and light material. perfect casual tee for warm weather. no shrinkage after washing in cold water and minimal wrinkles when hung immediately.,Positive
Love the quality and fit! it runs small so i got one size bigger.,Positive
"This is a gorgeous dress that while it runs quite small ( i normally take a s or xs ). i had to exchange it for a medium. i am 5 4"" and it falls below the knee which is how i like my dresses. it is a gorgeous pattern of color which could be worn for 3 seasons. i look forward to wearing it for many special occasions.",Positive
This fits like a dream! the almost three quarter length sleeves are perfection. worth every penny!,Positive
Wasn't sure about this but got the xs/s on sale. the style is very wide and is longer on me than pictured. somehow it works because it drapes nicely from my shoulders. should be comfy to wear in the summer. the two i received are a deep turquoise and will pair nicely with some of my favorite jewelry.,Positive
"A versatile, pretty and feminine addition to your closet. perfect with black pants, jeans, shorts...dress it up, dress it down.",Positive
I can't wait for the milder weather to arrive so i can wear this tunic. it is very stylish and elegant and one of those rare pieces that makes you feel good wearing it.,Positive
"This dress is very pretty in person, and perfect for warm and hot weather. the material is comfy and breathable, and the length is perfect. for reference, i usually wear a medium in retailer dresses, and ordered this in a medium as well. at that size, it does not bunch up around the waist as much as it would if i had ordered a large, but then the fit would have been baggier elsewhere on my body. i am fine with it being a closer fit across my waist, so i would say it fits true to size for me, but w",Positive

"This top is absolutely gorgeous!! i ordered in xs and unfortunately could not button it, too tight. for reference i am 5-3"", 120 lbs, 34b. i will definately be exchanging it for a size s, i just love how classy and glamorous this top is. i do wish it were a few inches longer, but it still looks so nice. i agree with other reviewer how nice it will go over a cocktail dress. hoping the size s has a better fit on me!",Positive
"I was excited when i saw these shorts in my local retailer store. i wear a 25 sometimes 26 and i grabbed an xs. however, when i tried these shorts on i was sad to see that they run big and looked baggy on me. they fit, but are really loose. i am probably going to have to return these because they don't come in an xxs. they are great shorts and a perfect length, but make sure you size down.",Positive
This would have been a cute top but the shoulder seams come halfway down the arm and give it a really weird shape. it looks smooth and fine on the model but in real life they stick out and make you look boxy. too bad!,Negative
"Alas, i so wanted to love this. the photos of the models wearing it look gorgeous -- flowy, drapey, ultimate grecian goddess. but it just doesn't work unless you're super-skinny. too much material. almost bulky; strange looking. the print is so beautiful -- i love the pink floral, and i love the whole idea of the dress. but it just doesn't work. have to send it back.

"I bought this beautiful  dress at the store yesterday and had some assistance from staff,  which was great.  the tie,  that another reviewer referred to, is essential,  i believe.  when tied in the back,  slightly high and sinched just enough to define smallest part of waist,  it falls beautifully and frames the center panel perfectly.  i, personally,   would never cut the tie off.  at least try it this way before making that decision.",Positive
"I bought this scarf/dress for 20% off on mother's day weekend. i really like how it looks and can be worn over a bathing suit or just as a dress, but it is not worth the money. it is poor quality, a scarf stitched together with an attached chord that you tie around your neck. you can make this yourself or wait until it is at least 50% off the original price.",Neutral
I am in love with this suit. i got the white floral. it's beautiful and classy. it feels like great quality too! i am going to get the black color too when it's back in stock. i am 5'9 and about 140lbs (32 dd) and i'm wearing a medium. i got both the small and medium and decided to keep the medium. it does have more fabric with the medium but the bigger size covers my chest and bigger bottom.,Positive

"Adore the bright embroidery against the black background!  mine was well done and no loose threads.  although this is all synthetic fabric (which i hate paying for!) but i couldn't help myself once i tried it on.  it's very roomy and if you're slender, size down unless you prefer the breezy swingy look like i do.  this is a three season dress that will do well with layers and without.  i picked regular hem instead of petite and it actually looks slimmer on me than the shorter version.",Positive
I thought this would be cute with leggings based upon the length on the model. i forget that the models are almost 6 feet tall. this has a polyester slip goes under it that snaps onto the shoulders. it came down to my knees and was completely like a sack no leggings and boots with this one. lovely material but not at all figure flattering.,Negative
"This is a lot shinier in person, and the elastic band is really tight but i still selected true to size.
there is a hi-lo hem going on that doesn't flatter my legs but it looks fantastic from the side.
due to the stiffness of the material and the tightness of the band, it can get crumply on the side if you don't get the right size. the material feels a little thin and scratchy.",Neutral
"Found this dress at my local retailer. . it was one of those dresses that just catches your eye.. very,very, beautiful print. . the dress is loose and flowy and feels so comfortable on. i purchased it without a second thought. i am 5'1"" and usually wear a 0 or 2 and the 2 was a better fit for me. so breezy and cool for summer.",Positive
"This is a flattering skirt for work or play. a few things to be aware of: 
- it is a lightweight knit without a lining (would travel great and never need ironing)
- the waist is quite high 
- the waist is quite slim (people with tummy self-consciousness might feel funny in it)
- the hang is flattering for people with butts and hips (such as myself)
- true to size for me

i decided not to keep it because i couldn't come up with enough tops to love it with and because for the money i would",Positive
"This shirt spoke to me, as soon as i entered the store! i love the colorful plaid, the flattering cut, and the light, airy material. at very least, i think this will be a three-season go to!",Positive
"First, thanks retailer for not putting itchy wool or fur in this! it's so soft! gorgeous bias for is super flattering for those of us with less than perfect bodies. for reference, i'm 5'5"", 32dd, 28, 38. size xs/s was perfect.",Positive
Saw this in my local and retailer store and had to have it! well made and easy to dress up for down. perfect with a light weight shirt tucked in for summer and early fall. i recommend sizing up one size.,Positive
Love these pants. also ordered them in blue. great fit and style.,Positive
"Unfortunately, i will need to exchange for a bigger size. i am 5""3"", 115 pounds. i normally wear a 2 or a 4. i ordered a 4 and they are a bit too tight. i am worried the 6 will be to big but love the pants enough to give that a try. excellent quality.",Positive
What a great light dress for spring and summer evenings. i love the length and the laid back style. this dress is true to size.,Positive
"I am very happy with this suit! it is gorgeous and very well made. my only suggestion is to use your normal swimsuit size when ordering rather than their recommendations. i am a 4-6 in dress size but am curvy with a large bust. i went with a medium because i thought there was no way i would wear a small! the medium actually fits great in the waist and bottom, however is small in the top for me. i'm ordering a large to compare coverage.",Positive
"Wish i had snagged both styles of this shirt before they sold out. this is a very cute, work appropriate top - good weight and quality to the shirt. i wear a lot of black and white at work (so sick of gray..why are all business clothes gray?) and this top will be added into my regular rotation.",Positive
"This is one of my absolute favorites! the design is perfect, and the fabric is so beautiful. i don't love the coral color, but the mixed pattern is amazing. it runs a little large. i sized down one size and it fit perfectly. it's very flowy and comfortable. it's these unique, special designs that end of being my favorite retailer purchases. i've gotten so many compliments. very highly recommend!",Positive
Awesome shirt...great transition into fall. somewhat sheer. extremely comfortable!,Positive
When i saw the dress i loved everything about it except the arms made me a little nervous. i ordered it when it went on sale and it turns it the arms are worse then i thought they would be. they are like my grandmother crochet it and accidentally attached my child's dress arms on my dress.,Negative
"I love this sweater. it's sort of like a tunic and sort of like a vest. i am pairing it with leggings and a white long sleeve tee underneath. i'm 5'3"" 109 lbs and the xs fit very well. i love the versatility and design of this.",Positive
"This is truly a beautiful top. the beading and lace are subtle, but add such a special, feminine touch. i love the breezy, swingy shape. very flattering. this is one item i will be sure to treasure for years to come. love!!",Positive
"This blouse is beautiful and true to size. i was so happy it fit after ordering it online. i'm a bit busty and broad but generally wear a m in most retailer tops and the m fit perfectly. length was perfect on me...not too long and not short. i'm 5'1"" for reference. definitely a top that can be worn dressed up with slacks and heels or skinny jeans and flats. love it!",Positive
"This dress is beautifully constructed. it is very fitted and does run on the small side. it will be a perfect derby dress. the lace is lovely and the pearl buttons are great touch. age appropriate for anyone..a very 
pretty dress. simple, classic and gorgeous!",Positive
"The tunic shown here (black and white) is the style i purchased, but not the color scheme. the one i got has a navy background with colorful large dots. the top is very cute, but has one drawback. it has covered buttons all the way down...and the top area gaps a bit so you can see your bra. i remedied the situation by sewing down the area on the placket around the top two buttons. worked like a charm! my new favorite top.",Positive
I own another pair of this brand and these are just as cute and fit the same. i wish the fabric was a bit nice but they still are super cute. they have wider leg holes which are flattering on my muscular build. nice and lightweight and sooooo comfy!,Positive
Such a cute top! i got the black with tiny car faces on it. absolutely adore it.,Positive
"I love this jacket! works so well with business casual outfits, and the color goes with almost everything! great over blouses or t shirts. by far my favorite purchase in quite a while!",Positive
"Beautifully made, incredible beadwork and detail. sleeves are extra long and a bit heavy (and cinched in multiple places, which feels strange), but the blouse is *gorgeous* and absolutely perfect for autumn. i'm gonna return and buy the size down.",Positive
"I coveted this item since i first saw it on instagram. i finally bought it in coral. it's a beautiful coat, the color is lovely and i like the way the hood makes a cute collar when worn down. the only problem is it looks like a bathrobe on me. i am 5'5"" and wear a size 8. i bought a medium, worried a small would not button. the sleeves are far too long. i do not want to go through the trouble of returning, so gave it to my daughter who is four inches taller. it looks cute in her.",Neutral
"I ordered online and got it home tried it on and loved it. it is too cute i plan to wear it with bright colored belt and shoes probably red, yellow, or pink plus i bought a polka dot tote same color cream and black and a blazer can't wait to wear it. i love the fact that i can wear it spring, summer, fall as well winter with my blazer. i'm keeping it.",Positive
"Too tight in strange ways. beautiful dress i was so excited to receive it, however it just did not fit.",Negative
"I was really hopeful that this top would work on me because it is so cute online. however, i was very disappointed when i finally received it. the sleeves look soft and snuggy in the picture but are actually a bit stiff and scratchy in person. i could almost get over the sleeves, but the white part of the shirt was horrible. i am 5'10 and a size 6. i wear a size small at retailer, and i got a small in this top. the bottom of the shirt was a tad short on me and hit just below my belt line-- which i",Negative
"But the back of it, by the waist, bunches just a tiny bit. if i get bigger, it will be too long. but i love the skirt, it is flattering and cute. not itchy for me even if the title says wool. i ordered the 00p and the length is pretty much as pictured, just below the knee in front. the waist is snug, bigger it would fall more on my hips (hence the too long comment earlier. (115 lbs, 26-27 in waist, short legs...)",Positive
Great fabric and color but fits like a potato sack -- so sad bc i would have loved it,Negative
I found this in my local atl store that carries petites before seeing it on-line. the materials is lovely and silky with a full lining. the top lace detailing is a nice touch and will make the dress stand out under jackets or sweaters for cool weather. this is great with any shoe type. very versatile year round piece alone or under layers. should be good for all body types.,Positive
"This is a casual, flattering off the shoulder float dress with pockets! perfect for sunday brunch or a casual night out. and, as other reviews stated the fabric is lightweight but you cannot see anything through it, except perhaps a glance of the outline of your legs but that is it. definitely not a reason to not buy this adorable dress!",Positive
"I really can't say enough about them. they have the perfect amount of stretch, are so comfortable and they keep their shape really well. i would say that you could wear them 3 times before washing. also, the color is perfect. they are tts and even allow for a little extra holiday weight without becoming a torture device.",Positive
"The picture of this top is misleading. it's more like a tent/ super short dress. i ordered my usual size (l) and could easily get away with a small in this top, if the arm holes were not too tight. i def. need to go down to a medium, and maybe even a petite medium since i'm 5/3. the top is 100% cotton, but there is so much fabric there is no way a little shrinkage would offset the amount of extra fabric. it looks like a tent on. plus, the picture and description make it seem like a normal top le",Neutral
"This white blouse is absolutely stunning in person. i wore it with a nude strapless bra. note to self: remove makeup before blouse, otherwise it's all over your blouse.",Positive
Didn't like the dress. look pregnant in it. this dress is going back.,Negative
"While shopping with my daughters, i bought this tee in white. i immediately felt guilty for spending too much on a white tee that was thin and see-through enough that i'd need to wear something underneath. i returned the white, but then retailer had a sale weekend, so i ordered the blue with a discount, so less guilt and the color is beautiful. i don't need to worry about wearing anything underneath - the fabric is very thin and super soft and feels so nice.",Positive
"Living in florida, i thought the design of this sweatshirt was to die for. i was so pleased with the quality when i received the top; however i was nervous to see that it recommended washing before wearing due to the dying process. i washed cold gentle cycle and tumble dried low. turned out perfect and did not shrink! it's adorable. plan to wear it with white denim shorts. i ordered a size 1 and i normally wear a size small.",Positive
"The fit on this jean is amazing, they just run large, and then they also stretch quite a bit after 1-2 wears. i am usually a solid size 30 (and have other pairs of dl1961s) but i am buying in a 28 - so i would say one or two sizes down from your usual size.",Positive
"I was disappointed in this bordeaux top, a brand i usually enjoy. i ordered a medium, my usual size in their tops. it was very very big and did not fit at all as pictured here. also, the fabric is somewhat sheer and while i tried it on wearing a darker bra, the combo of being way too large and a bit sheer was enough for me to return it.",Neutral
"This was a near miss for me. i love the concept of the asymmetrical shoulder cutouts and the contrast of the beadwork to the simple gray crewneck, however, with some of the beads bulging out about 1/4 inch from the shirt, i have to say it almost bordered on gawdy christmas sweater status... but still cool. i actually thought this piece felt fairly sturdy and well-made, but the thing that got me and led me to return it was that even in an xs it was indeed cut wide. if it were a little shorter it",Positive
"Love this top! i tried it on in the store and instantly loved. i wore it and ordered it in another color. i bought my usual size but decided i'd like to have it slightly smaller for the next one, so i ordered down. it can go either way, it's quite flawy and roomy. cool for summer and supper flattering.",Positive
I love the print on these pants. they are beautifully flowy and flattering. the only downside is that they are see through so i'm going to take them to tailor to have a lining put in up to the knee so i can wear them to places other than the beach. i bought them on sale today in the store and bought a size small.,Positive
"Must have - i splurged on the white style and red style; couldn't choose between the two. shape of shirt worked for me. the white style isn't too thin that you have to wear something underneath. costly for the quality of fabric, but i had a gift card, and it is retailer after all.",Positive
"This dress is definitely light weight and it requires a slip or you could wear a black tank and tights with boots. there wasn't a security tag in mine so no holes when i bought in store. i even accidentally caught it on a costume bracelet and it did not rip or damage. although, you probably wouldn't want to sit on concrete or rub against something rough. i would recommend this dress- its gorgeous on. for the price, i think it should come with a slip. fyi, the back half of the waist has elastic,",Positive
"Love the top, but very small to the size. ordered a medium and had to send back in exchange for x-large.",Negative
"I ordered this top on sale and so glad that i did. i am usually a small in tops, but had read that it runs small. i went with a medium and wish that i picked the small. it is definitely a swing top. it's best feature is the detailing; it's gorgeous. i paired it with jeans and a white denim jacket.",Positive
"This dress is great, and looks even prettier in person, the colors are more vibrant. the ruching is very forgiving for the belly and the length is perfect. most maxi's are too long on me, but i ordered a ps and it fit perfect. my only complaint is that it is very low cut, which i was unaware of standing up, but when i sat down at a dinner party, well, let's just say i gave everyone a show :(. recommend wearing a cami or something underneath.",Positive
Beautiful dress. the details are lovely. it feels a little bit like a nightgown. i always wear a slip. bust does run a little small so i unbutton the first few buttons. armholes feel a little small also.,Positive
"Pros: material is amazing, super soft and quality thickness (but not like uber this, just enough, it will last). also seems like it won't wrinkle much which would make it a great dress to throw in a bag for a trip. fits well in the shoulders, chest and the length is good.

cons: the ""waist"" line is really tight and really really high. i'm 5'8"", 150lbs and my usual medium is pretty tight. of course it hits me on the rib cage too, which is so weird. it's way higher than it should be.

i'll pro",Neutral
I am loving these. they are quite long but are prefect to wear with pj shorts or leggings. very soft and cozy.,Positive
"I know this product description says oversized but that's an understatement. i ordered a small and tried it on and i looked like a little kid in their father's jacket. i don't even think an xs would have worked. i'm 5'6"" and about 135 pounds for reference. i will say that the embroidery on the back is very cool and this jacket is overall a cool concept but it's just way too big.",Negative
"I saw the shirt at my local retailer store and loved the color and print; however, the shirt had way too much fabric!  i was swimming in it.  it was not flattering whatsoever.  plus, it's overpriced for a shirt.  i'm sadly returning it.",Neutral
Looking forward to wearing this on a beach holiday !,Positive
Love this soft sweatshirt. the peplum makes it a little different and the quality is great. go to piece for spring. loose fitting but true to size in shoulders.,Positive
"Very disappointed that i ordered this dress and a large was too big. returned and asked for an exchange to a size medium, it was apparently not available in the medium, i was charged a 5.95 fee for return shopping. so i immediately went to website, medium available and i had to pay another 12.95 for shipping. seems a bit unreasonable, but really liked the dress.",Negative
"This dress is a new favorite! the cut is great for most figures and the fabric has a nice drape around the curves of the body so it sort of has a slimming effect - which i love! i'm petite and curvy and so the hem lands closer to top of my knees than it does on the model in the image. the color in person is slightly more purple and less brown/maroon, but it still works for a fall/winter wardrobe. if you are uneasy about the colors, i recommend looking at it in store before purchasing. i love thi",Positive
"These days i am more like a 6 after gaining some weight. when i was in my local retailer the other day i happened upon this dress only in a small/petite. i tried it on and it actually fit me very well. i am 5 foot 6 so i thought the petite might be too short or wouldn't work, but surprisingly it fit my body type. i think i'll like wearing it best with a pair of wedges or heels. like most other reviews i'm inclined to agree that the regular size has too much fabric going on and probably is s",Positive
"I seriously love this skirt! i bought it for my college graduation and i was complimented by everyone that saw it. not only that, but it is beyond versatile, you can dress it up, make it casual, or make it professional. it is extremely ideal especially for the price. it also is the most comfortable skirt i've ever worn, so that's a plus.",Positive
"These jeans have definitely made me an ag convert. the fit is perfection and at 5'3"", it is so to buy jeans and simply wear them (without the typical extra 4-6"" of length).",Positive
"I bought these on sale and love, love them! they are comfortable and super cute with the print detail on the calves and around the waist. i am waiting to receive the matching hoodie. don't know it i will wear them together since i don't like to be too ""matchy"". i have worn the leggings with a long black tunic top and grey slip on sneakers. very happy with this purchase!",Positive
Great fitting and super cute!!!!! my husband said this is the cutest bathing suit i've owned!!! and i live in bathing suits!!!,Positive
Love these jeans! the material is soft and very flattering on the hips.,Positive
"I actually love the fit of this t. the photo of the model does make it look more of a straight fit - but i love that it has more of a flared shape. the armholes are high enough that it covers that bit of arm chub i hate, it swings out enough that it looks a little dressy and a little more special than your basic t, and it drapes nicely even over my curvy shape.",Positive
Great piece. using as a night gown. slept in it last night. like a dream.,Positive
"This top is very flattering, the fabric flows and moves. it fits perfectly (slim cut), but hides tummy bulges and other imperfections. and it's slimming too. can be dressed up or down, goes with everything. i ended up buying all three colors, and if there were more, i would buy more!",Positive
"I really wanted to love this shirt. the snowflake and stripe design is really cute, and the fabric is of nice quality. it's a very loose fit, which i would've been willing to work with, but... as mentioned in previous reviews, the shoulder seam rests in an odd place on your upper arm, and there are little bumps in the fabric on the arms that appear similar to what happens if you leave a shirt on a wire hanger too long. it looks like you have nubby little wings coming out of your arms. not attrac",Negative
I love the design of this top.  the pattern is beautiful and the back unique.   i am a mom of two so i really appreciate the extra front coverage.  i can run around at the beach with my kids and not be worried about overexposure.  i am a 34d on top and purchased the large and it fits well.,Positive
Tried this after missing out on the very similar terra max dress where petite sizes sold out. the medium is perfect and the style can be dressed up. wore it on a day out and two strangers complimented me on the 'great dress'!,Positive
"I never would have thought that i could wear a jumpsuit and it actually look good on me, but this is it!!! the fabric is weighted some so it lays very flattering and is very comfortable. the sash can be tied several ways-front, back, or side. i will be traveling in this to the beach and pairing it with an retailer wrap, and then wearing it alone with sandals once we exit the freezing airplanes. a racer back bra works great with this piece and the pockets are an added bonus. it looks like a d",Positive
"I ordered this in the peach color and it is a beautiful pale color. the underside of the cuff has a pretty pattern on it, so if you roll it up once it adds a little something extra! it is extremely see through though so you might want to wear a tank under!",Positive
"Gorgeous but just too short in length for anyone with a long torso.  i sized up to get more length, but then the neck opening was way too big and hung open to expose - well, everything up top.  wearing a cami would be an option but would take away from the dressiness of the top.  i had to leave without this item, but was disappointed because i love the colors and cut otherwise!",Neutral
"This shirt is beautiful, however i thought that it was made of a softer, lighter material. it is, instead, made of a thick, heavy material that was unflattering for my shape. ( short torso ann's large bust) it made me look boxy and chunky in the middle. sadly, i'll be returning it.",Neutral
"I wanted this this top when i saw it online but was hesitant when i read the review however i went to the store and was able to try it on, good thing. i'm not a fan of the off white/beige material but really like the black style. i had no problem with the shoulders staying down. idid get it in a small a size up for me.",Positive
These are very stylish. if you are short they are a little baggy at the bottom. they are a bit over-priced. i bought them before they went on sale. good quality and feel light and airy.,Positive
This skirt is so cute. this is a staple to have in your wardrobe. i wear it with boots and boot socks. but tights for cold winter days as well as flip flops in the summer. i got my true size of 4. its fits perfectly. i love the length with a peek of leg when you walk!,Positive
"The look is frest, crisp with a touch of romance. very retailer!",Positive
"I love the color patterns and fabric.  it has full lining!  my biggest problem with the dress is the swing style - makes it more like a maternity dress and so unflattering?  a straight (shift) style would have been much better.  dress runs large, however the arm/shoulder area is tight.",Negative
"This is a really great bathing suit top. i haven't purchased a bikini in about 4 years so i'm glad this is the one i finally purchased. the floral pattern is dainty and gorgeous. the fabric itself is soft and comfortable. i listed it as a 'true to size' fit, but if you're on the larger end of your size spectrum i would get the size up for better coverage. i'm a size 8 through and through, and so ordered a m per their size standards. the size m was comfortable and fit but the size l covered bette",Positive
